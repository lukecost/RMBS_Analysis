<TD>Missing Affiliated Business Disclosure for xxxxx.&nbsp;&nbsp;Per the FACTS sheet the lender has affiliates.</TD>
<TD>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD>Verified liquid assets and/or savings history - Borrower has sufficient verified assets/reserves.&nbsp;&nbsp;xxxxx months of reserves have been verified with a minimum requirement of xxxxx mths.; Low LTV/CLTV/HCLTV - LTV/CLTV is xxxxx% w/a max allowed of xxxxx% for an OO/Purchase per the guideline matrix.; Verified credit history - Borrower has a mid FICO of xxxxx w/a minimum requirement of xxxxx for an OO/Purchase per the guideline matrix.; No Apparent Right to Statutory Damages - Override to EV2 due to Immaterial Issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;No assignee liability.</TD>
<TD>Investor forwarded the comments from the seller:<BR>
<BR>
I received the below info from Legal regarding the Affiliated Business Disclosure (ABD) issue as noted in the blue text.<BR>
<BR>
I believe the affiliate business disclosure is only required in the event there is a referral. It is my understanding that xxxxx did not/does not refer business to affiliates.<BR>
<BR>
I have done some additional research, and based on what I can find, the ABD is required when we have an Affiliate that is a settlement service provider and we referred the borrower.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Affiliates are not a Settlement Service provider nor did we refer the borrower; thus the disclosure is not required.<BR>
<BR>
Exception remains as the seller has affiliates and should disclose them to the borrower to be in compliance with RESPA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seller has not provided a list of their affiliates they have so unable to confirm if any were used.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best practice is to disclose all affiliates as part of initial disclosures; referrals can be made verbally and indirectly&nbsp;&nbsp;so it is not possible to confirm from a document file if any referrals were provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ABD is not required when the lender has no affiliates, but should be provided consistently when they do to maintain adherence to RESPA.</TD>
