Report Credit Risk Solutions Contact Information CLIENT SERVICE MANAGEMENT Legal Name: Credit Risk Solutions LLC Tom Millon, CEO
of Computershare Loan Services 8742 Lucent Boulevard, Highlands Ranch, CO 80129 Item 4: Description of the Due Diligence Performed
OVERVIEW Type of Assets Reviewed On behalf of MFA Financial, Inc. (&ldquo;Client&rdquo;), Credit Risk Solutions LLC, including
its contract employees employed by other third party due diligence companies (&ldquo;Contract Employees&rdquo;), (collectively
&ldquo;CRS&rdquo;)<SUP>1 </SUP>conducted an independent third-party loan level due diligence review (&ldquo;Review&rdquo;) of
residential mortgage loan files and business purpose loan files, together referred to as the &ldquo;Loans&rdquo;, designated by
the Client in connection with residential mortgage backed securities issuance. The loans referenced in this executive summary
were reviewed from July 2018 to August 2018 with origination dates from February 2016 to May 2018. Imaged files were provided
by the Client to CRS for review. Credit Risk Solutions LLC used agents and Contract Employees employed by other third-party due
diligence companies to complete the review and initial grading of the Loans. Credit Risk Solutions LLC acted as an intermediary
between the Contract Employees and the Client. Credit Risk Solutions LLC performed the following intermediary tasks: Credit Risk
Solutions LLC received exception reports from Contract Employees and provided same to the Client. Client provided rebuttal responses
to Credit Risk Solutions LLC directly. Credit Risk Solutions LLC reviewed the initial rebuttal responses and provided the Client<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&rsquo;</FONT>s
rebuttals with supporting documentation to the Contract Employees. If Contract Employees were unable to clear the rebuttal, the
issue was escalated to Credit Risk Solutions LLC who completed research and resolution. Credit Risk Solutions LLC reviewed and
delivered updated Loan reports to the Client. Credit Risk Solutions LLC analyzed the reports provided by the Contract Employees
and stratified the data to confirm the consistency of the data reported. Credit Risk Solutions LLC looked for inconsistencies,
trends and the concentration of exceptions in such reports and notified its Contract Employees of any errors or inconsistencies
upon review and research. Where necessary, Credit Risk Solutions LLC would escalate Loans to its compliance and legal department
for review, research and resolution, if applicable. Such conclusions would be relayed to its contract employees to update reporting.
Credit Risk Solutions LLC completed all redaction on rating agency reports. Credit Risk Solutions LLC re-opened a sample of 58
files during the final reporting reconciliation to validate the changes requested by the Client that were not adjusted by the
Contract Employees. Such reviews were targeted <SUP>1</SUP> As stated herein, the term &ldquo;CRS&rdquo; includes Contract Employees
employed by other third-party due diligence companies. Except for the items listed under &ldquo;Types of Assets Reviewed,&rdquo;
any reference to &ldquo;CRS&rdquo; includes work completed by these Contract Employees and not necessarily directly by Credit
Risk Solutions LLC. 4 &gt; Computershare</FONT></P>

THIRD PARTY REVIEW (&ldquo;TPR&rdquo;) SCOPE OF WORK The scope of work for this transaction consisted of credit, property valuation,
regulatory compliance review and, if applicable, a business purpose review. Additionally, a data integrity check was performed
in accordance with Standard and Poor<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&rsquo;</FONT>s and DBRS Morningstar
Credit Ratings loan level review standards in place as of the date of the review. This is referred to as a &ldquo;Review&rdquo;.
SAMPLE SIZE OF THE ASSETS REVIEWED During the securitization evaluation process, the Client may have removed loans that were reviewed
by CRS from the securitization for paid-in-full mortgage loans or other items that were not disclosed to CRS. The final population
of the Review covered 262 Loans totaling an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $81.687 million. The Review
encompassed 100% of the securitization population to the best of CRS<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&rsquo;</FONT>s
knowledge. Within this population there were 141 Loans that were reviewed by CRS to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(&ldquo;NRSROs&rdquo;), standard for compliance, credit, and valuation (the &ldquo;Residential Population&rdquo;) and 121 Loans
that were not reviewed for compliance given the stated loan purpose of Outside Dodd Frank (&ldquo;ODF&rdquo;) which included 5

Report business purpose loans (the &ldquo;Business Purpose Population&rdquo;). Review Type Loan Count Reviewed by CRS Scope Applied
Residential Population Full Review 141 CRS performed a full review of all components based on the scope described below. Business
Purpose Population Limited 121 CRS performed a full review of credit Review and property valuation and a limited review of compliance
based on the scope described below. Total Loan Population 262 The Review was completed on 100% of the residential and business
purpose loan files submitted to CRS to the best of its knowledge. LOAN GRADING Loans reviewed in this pool were given credit underwriting,
property valuation and regulatory compliance grades, as applicable. Each Loan received an &ldquo;initial&rdquo; and a &ldquo;final&rdquo;
grade. CRS<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&rsquo;</FONT> loan grading is solely based on CRS<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&rsquo;
</FONT>independent assessment of all guideline exceptions and compensating factors for each of the component reviews. CRS is providing
a comprehensive loan-level analysis as part of this pre-securitization reporting package which includes initial grades, final
grades and detailed commentary on the rationale for any changes in grades and sets forth compensating factors and waivers. Initial
Grades The &ldquo;initial&rdquo; grade was assigned during the initial Loan review. CRS assigned initial loan securitization grades
for each sub-category (credit underwriting, property valuation, and regulatory compliance) based on the initial review of the
loan documentation provided. The initial overall loan securitization grade was the highest risk grade of all sub-grades. Finding
Resolution Following the initial due diligence review, CRS worked with the lender to review and, where applicable, potentially
resolve findings identified in the initial review. A finding could be resolved, and the final event grade modified, only if additional
supporting documentation or documented commentary was provided to CRS by the lender that warranted a different finding and grade
revision. Any additional documentation and/or commentary provided by the lender was inventoried in the file and/or documented
in the loan finding. Both the review of new information and the resulting impact on the specific finding and event grades were
documented. In the event of a grade revision, the Loan included detailed commentary to explain why the grade changed and supporting
documentation received. In the event the lender could not resolve a finding, CRS escalated the finding to the Client for review.
The Client, in some instances, accepted the finding based on the materiality of the finding and the compensating factors in the
file. CRS documented the Client<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&rsquo;</FONT>s decision to accept the
finding(s) as an exception. The accepted finding is reflected in the final event grading. 6 &gt; Computershare</FONT></P>

Report Final Grade The &ldquo;final&rdquo; grade considered the additional information and supporting documentation that may have
been provided by the lender to clear outstanding conditions. Detailed commentary was captured and has been reported to explain
loan findings, event grades and event grade revisions. Reported data, including calculated values, represent the information found
in the loan file during the TPR and are not the values submitted by the lender or Client. TPR COMPONENT REVIEW SCOPE CRS reviewed
the selected Loans with respect to the presence or absence of relevant documents and the accuracy and completeness of data fields.
Credit Review The following elements were reviewed on this transaction. For more detail, please refer to Appendix A: Assessed
the characteristics of the mortgage loans and the borrowers to confirm they met the guidelines; Confirmed all borrowers signing
the documents were of legal age, typically 18 years or older, at the time of the mortgage loan origination; Confirmed all riders
required by the terms of the Mortgage/Deed of Trust and Note were attached to the respective document; Evaluated the consistency
of the social security number across the various documents; and Re-calculated the Debt-to-Income ratio (&ldquo;DTI&rdquo;), loan-to-value
ratio (&ldquo;LTV&rdquo;), combined loan-to-value ratio (&ldquo;CLTV&rdquo;), high total loan to value ratio (&ldquo;HTLTV&rdquo;),
income and liabilities and compared these against the guidelines; Analyzed asset documentation to determine compliance with the
guidelines for funds to close and reserves; Evaluated evidence of borrower<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&rsquo;</FONT>s
willingness and ability to repay the obligation, as applicable; and Examined any anti-fraud reports in the Loan for red flags.
Property Valuation Review The following elements were reviewed on this transaction. For more detail, please refer to Appendix
B: Original Property Appraisal o CRS reviewed the original appraisal provided to determine if it was complete, thorough and the
value was reasonable supported. Value Supported Analysis o CRS applied a cascade methodology to determine if the original appraised
value was reasonably supported when compared to an independent third-party valuation product. There are more secondary products
ordered than loans in the pool. o The breakdown is as follows on the 262 loans: On 257 loans, AVM<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&rsquo;</FONT>s
were ordered by the Originator at origination; On 35 loans, BPO<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&rsquo;</FONT>s
were ordered by the Originator at origination; On 6 loans, a second appraisal was ordered by the Originator at origination due
to the loan balance of the loan; and On 180 loans, an AVE was ordered by the Client post-close to validate value on a sample of
the loans. All 180 were completed by RedBell. CRS had independent access to the reviews on this population of loans. 7 &gt; Computershare</FONT></P>

Compliance scope of review for this transaction is summarized below. For more detail, please refer to Appendix C. CRS used Ellie
Mae<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">&rsquo;</FONT>s Mavent Compliance Service (&ldquo;Mavent&rdquo;),
an industry recognized third party compliance tool, for regulatory testing. Mavent is not an affiliate of CRS and is solely responsible
for the content and accuracy of its rule generation. Information contained in any CRS report related to applicable statute of
limitations for certain claims may not be accurate or reflect the most recent controlling case law. All final decisions as to
whether to purchase or enter into a transaction related to any individual Loan, any investment strategy and any legal conclusions,
including the potential liability related to the purchase or other transaction involving any such mortgage Loan, shall be made
solely by the Client, or other agreed upon party, that has engaged CRS to prepare its reports pursuant to its guidelines and instructions.
The Client, or other agreed upon party, acknowledges and agrees that the scoring models applied by CRS are designed to identify
potential risk and the Client, or other agreed upon party, assumes sole responsibility for determining the suitability of the
information for its use. The Anti-Steering disclosure was not in the scope of review and was not tested. If available, CRS noted
the presence of recorded documents. When the loans were initially reviewed by CRS, the population was new production; as such,
the documents were not recorded when the due diligence review was completed by CRS. In lieu of the recorded documents, CRS reviewed
the closing instructions in the Loan to confirm it included lender instructions for recording, and, as applicable, the date the
documents were sent for recording and/or the date the documents would be sent for recording. A full compliance review was completed
on the residential loan population that was subject to Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&ldquo;Dodd-Frank&rdquo;)

Report Business Purpose Loans secured by residential real property are exempt from certain provisions of the Truth in Lending
Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation Z, and as a result are designated as outside of Dodd-Frank (&ldquo;ODF&rdquo;)
and are coded as Business Purpose Loans, as they received a limited compliance review due to this exemption. DATA INTEGRITY CRS
compared data fields on the tape provided by the Client to the data captured during the due diligence review. Discrepancies between
the two data sets were stored and reported in the data comparison report and reconciled with the Client to produce the final Mortgage
Loan Schedule (MLS). Since the securitization population includes loans from different periods of time and from differing transactions,
not all data elements were provided on every loan. DATA CAPTURE CRS collected data fields required to create the American Securitization
Forum (&ldquo;ASF&rdquo;) and rating agency required data points relating to ATR/QM determination, which is provided in the reporting
package. When the data was available, the following fields were compared in the data comparison report if each data point was

Review Scope to the Loans while completing the due diligence review. Final Compliance grades and conclusions were established
in good faith based upon the final grading scheme as defined by the RMBS 3.0 TRID Compliance Review scope and the applicable rating
agency criteria. CRS relied on the prescribed cures under TRID and to the extent cure under TRID was not applicable, CRS relied
