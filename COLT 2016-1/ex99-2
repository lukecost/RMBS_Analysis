TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Loan Calculations: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 11/9/2015 disclosed a Total of Payments that does not match the actual total of payments for the loan. (Final/11/09/2015)
Figure used by lender appears to exclude the loan costs.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-02-18): The TOP disclosed on the corrected CD included the Lender-Paid Broker Compensation of $3,540.00.  Per OC feedback, the Lender-Paid Broker Compensation would not have been disclosed on the LE pursuant to 37(f), therefore would not be included in the TOP disclosed on the Closing Disclosure.


Reviewer Comment (2016-02-16): Exception Remains


Reviewer Comment (2016-02-16): Regarding the TOP calculation used by the lender on this corrected CD, will be graded as an EV2 based on the inclusion of fees from A, B, and C that are not paid by the consumer.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure Fee Terminology and Order
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 11/9/2015 did not use the same fee terminology or did not list the fees in the same sequential order as the Loan Estimate. (Final/11/09/2015)
Loan Estimates and Closing Disclosures reflects various fee name changes (Title, Processing, Appraisal).  Fee names are required to be disclosed consistently.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-06): The final LE in the file reflects appraisal review fee, Closing Disclosure dated 11/9/2015 reflects as 2nd Appraisal fee and lender cured with post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 1/9/2016; however, this disclosure reflects hazard and county property taxes for escrows versus prior disclosure of homeowner's insurance and property taxes.  An additional post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 2/18/2016 reflects both the appraisal field review fee and the homeowner's and property tax escrows correctly and cured the exception.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure Total Interest Percentage
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Loan Calculations: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 11/17/2015 disclosed a Total Interest Percentage that does not match the actual total interest percentage for the loan. (Final/11/17/2015)
Disclosure reflects 122.88000%.  Actual is 120.73300%, resulting in a variance = 2.147%.  Overdisclosure appears due to the Index Value.  Based on Amortization Schedule, the lender adjusted to a FIR = 6%.  The highest value in the lookback is .93610, which results in a FIR 5.875.  Using FIR 6% results in TIP = 122.888%.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-12): Remediation after 60 days, based on Assignee liability limited to actual damages the grade adjusted to EV2-B.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-25): Lender provided  a post consummation CD dated 4/21/2016 that reflects a TIP of 120.734% which matches the calculated TIP; however, both this post consummation CD and the 2/18/2016 CD are over 60 days from discovery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-06): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 2/18/2016 that reflects a TIP of 120.734% which matches the calculated TIP of 120.233% within tolerance but is outside 60 days from consummation.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure Total Of Payments
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Loan Calculations: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 11/17/2015 disclosed a Total of Payments that does not match the actual total of payments for the loan. (Final/11/17/2015)
Disclosure reflects $951,664.75.  Actual is $947720.35.  Overdisclosure appears due to the Index Value.  Based on Amortization Schedule, the lender adjusted to a FIR = 6%.  The highest value in the lookback is .93610, which results in a FIR 5.875.  Using the index value 6% results in a Total of Payments = 951660.60.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-02-18): Regarding the TOP calculation used by the lender on this corrected CD, will be graded as an EV2 based on the inclusion of fees from A, B, and C that are not paid by the consumer.


Reviewer Comment (2016-02-16): The TOP disclosed on the Final CD and the corrected CD appears to be based on the fully indexed rate of 6.00%.  Per the terms of the ARM note, the fully indexed rate would not exceed 5.875%.

Disclosure reflects $256,281.25.   Actual is $250,592.69 for a difference of $5,688.56.  Used index provided by lender.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-02-18): Regarding the TOP calculation used by the lender on this corrected CD, will be graded as an EV2 based on the inclusion of fees from A, B, and C that are not paid by the consumer.


Reviewer Comment (2016-02-16): The TOP disclosed on the corrected CD included the Lender-Paid Broker Compensation of $1,680.00.  Per OC feedback, the Lender-Paid Broker Compensation would not have been disclosed on the LE pursuant to 37(f), therefore would not be included in the TOP disclosed on the Closing Disclosure.

Approved Exception:  Exception to allow use of 2014 business returns on 3 of the 9 businesses that are lacking a stamp from the IRS as required by Caliber's tax transcript policy.  Caliber's policy is to 1st attempt validating the filing of the business returns by the IRS validation directly from the IRS.  If not available the alternative is to provide IRS stamped returns.  In this instance, the IRS does not have a record of the returns on file yet (filed 9/15/15).  Since the borrower sent these returns via certified mail, there is not an option to have them stamped by the IRS.  To ensure validation we have a CPA's endorsement on company letterhead, certified mail receipts and all 2014 Returns have been signed by the CPA.  The businesses in question are Pain Mangagment, Flossmoor Pain Institute and Ayesha Akbar MDSC.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure Fee Terminology and Order
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 11/24/2015 did not use the same fee terminology or did not list the fees in the same sequential order as the Loan Estimate. (Final/11/24/2015)
Various fee names changed between various loan estimates, and between loan estimates and closing disclosures.
11 months reserves > 9 months guideline minimum

Borrower has a disposable income of $8,672.000 with $7,612.00 required.

Borrower has bonus income not included in the effective income.
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-22): Review of the file reflects the post consummation CD cured the escrow terminology and the Admin fee was cured with the re-disclosed LE dated 10/22/2015 and all subsequent LE's and CD's with Admin fee versus the initial GFE as Underwriting fee.


Seller Comment (2016-04-22): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the terminology for all fees was cured.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-06): Post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 1/22/2016 does correct the escrow terminology to homeowner's insurance and property taxes but the final LE in the file reflects Underwriting fee, the initial LE reflects Underwriting fee and the interim LE's reflect Admin fee while all CD's reflect Admin fee.

Reviewer Comment (2016-02-18): Regarding the TOP calculation used by the lender on this corrected CD, will be graded as an EV2 based on the inclusion of fees from A, B, and C that are not paid by the consumer.


Reviewer Comment (2016-02-16): The TOP disclosed on the corrected CD included the Lender-Paid Broker Compensation of $11,870.01.  Per OC feedback, the Lender-Paid Broker Compensation would not have been disclosed on the LE pursuant to 37(f), therefore would not be included in the TOP disclosed on the Closing Disclosure.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure Fee Terminology and Order
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 12/3/2015 did not use the same fee terminology or did not list the fees in the same sequential order as the Loan Estimate. (Final/12/03/2015)
Various changed fees names were reflected on the different disclosures.
65.59% LTV < 80 guideline max

Housing expense increase is minimal.  Current $1,485 with increase to $1,786
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-26): Post consummation CD provided cured the terminology for the escrows and the remainder of the fees terminology matches the final LE provided.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-06): Post consummation Closing Disclosure provided by Lender does reflect the correct terminology for the escrows; however, there are alternating terminologies for using Origination Fee versus Administrative fee and Attorney Fee, Title - Closing Attorney Fee - Borrower Chosen and Title - Closing/Settlement/Attorney fee throughout the LE's and CD's.

Reviewer Comment (2016-05-05): Review of the file reflects the TOP error was discovered on 4/7/2016 and that the post consummation correcting the error was provided within 60 days of discovery.  Condition cured.


Seller Comment (2016-05-05): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that discovery of the incorrect TOP was on 4/7/2016.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-28): Post consummation CD provided by lender has the same TOP as the CD provided on 4/7/2016 and based on the amortization schedule lender is using an index value that is within the lookback period per the Note.  Once this index value is used the TOP of $1,051,774.45 on both the 4/7/2016 and 4/20/2016 CD's matches the calculated TOP of $1,051,774.37 within allowed tolerance.  However, neither corrected CD provided is within 60 days of discovery.


Seller Comment (2016-04-28): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 4/20/2016 and an amortization schedule


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-21): Post consummation CD provided by lender still reflects an incorrect TOP and is outside the required 60 days from discovery.


Seller Comment (2016-04-21): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 4/7/2016.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-07): Post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 2/5/2016 reflects a TOP of $1,076,374.61 which still incorrectly includes the lender paid broker compensation.

TRID Service Provider Timing
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Borrower did not receive a list of service providers within 3 business days of application.
The initial SSPL disclosure was blank and reflected no services or vendors.  The SSPL with the 12/1 Loan Estimate reflected service and vendor appropriately.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-22): SSPL in file dated 10/19/2015 although non-compliant was provided within 3 general business days of application.  This condition cleared and SSPL non-compliant exception set.


Reviewer Comment (2016-02-16): Even though the fees were held to a tighter tolerance, the exception is surrounding the timing of the SSPL, not the tolerance issue. If the lender is allowing the borrower to shop for services, they are required to provide the borrower a SSPL within 3 business days of application. 
12 CFR 1026.19(e)(1)(6)(C) states that "If the consumer is permitted to shop for a settlement service, the creditor shall provide the consumer with a written list identifying available providers of that settlement service and stating that the consumer may choose a different provider for that service. The creditor must identify at least one available provider for each settlement service for which the consumer is permitted to shop. The creditor shall provide this written list of settlement service providers separately from the disclosures required by paragraph (e)(1)  of this section but in accordance with the timing requirements in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section."


Seller Comment (2016-02-16): Although the SSPL did not reference service providers, the fees pertaining to 10% were all upheld to tolerance as if they had been chosen.  Non-monetary issue

TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Loan Calculations: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 12/3/2015 disclosed a Total of Payments that does not match the actual total of payments for the loan. (Final/12/03/2015)

Reviewer Comment (2016-02-18): Regarding the TOP calculation used by the lender on this corrected CD, will be graded as an EV2 based on the inclusion of fees from A, B, and C that are not paid by the consumer.


Reviewer Comment (2016-02-16): The TOP disclosed on the corrected CD included the Lender-Paid Broker Compensation of $4,678.20.  Per OC feedback, the Lender-Paid Broker Compensation would not have been disclosed on the LE pursuant to 37(f), therefore would not be included in the TOP disclosed on the Closing Disclosure.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure Fee Terminology and Order
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 12/9/2015 did not use the same fee terminology or did not list the fees in the same sequential order as the Loan Estimate. (Final/12/09/2015)
Loan Estimate reflects Homeowner's Insurance while Closing Disclosure reflects Hazard Insurance.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-27): Lender cured with post consummation CD reflecting the escrows correctly as homeowner's insurance.


Seller Comment (2016-04-27): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 2/4/2016.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-25): Review of the CD provided reflects the CD belongs to a different borrower/property.  Please provide CD for subject transaction.


Seller Comment (2016-04-25): Lender indicated a corrected post consummation CD was provided.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-07): Post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 1/9/2016 still reflects escrows incorrectly as hazard insurance and county property taxes

Reviewer Comment (2016-03-14): The initial Loan Estimate in the file dated 11/10/2015 reflects the loan locked through 12/09/2015 and indicates there are no escrows.  Re-disclosed Loan Estimate dated 11/13/2015 and 11/20/2015 both reflect the same lock through date with no escrows.  Although the lender indicates that an escrow waiver done on 11/19/2015 with the .25 increase in points there is no justification since the loan was locked from initial Loan Estimate through closing with no escrows.  In addition, the final Closing Disclosure dated 12/05/2015 does not indicate an escrow waiver fee on pg 4.  Condition remains.


Seller Comment (2016-03-14): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that escrow accounts are required for HPML loans but in CA they are eligible for waiver if the LTV is less than or equal to 90%, an escrow waiver was completed on 11/19/2015 which caused an additional pricing cots of .25% which was the only fee to increase.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-09): Lender provided a copy of the final Closing Disclosure dated 12/05/2015 along with a rebuttal indicating the closing costs decreased from the Loan Estimate and is not exceeding no dollar amount needed; however, the Loan Estimate dated 11/13/2015 reflects the loan locked with no discount points and the redisclosed Loan Estimate dated 11/20/2015 has the same lock thru date with increased discount points and no valid COC justifying the increase, The most valid Loan Estimate is being used and 0% tolerance exceeded by the discount points.


Seller Comment (2016-03-09): Lender provided a copy of the final Closing Disclosure dated 12/05/2015 along with a rebuttal indicating the closing costs decreased from the Loan Estimate and is not exceeding no dollar amount needed.

Reviewer Comment (2016-04-06): The rebuttal provided by lender indicates that the pricing increase was due to a request for a higher loan amount which caused the LTV to be increased from 70% to 75% and also provided a copy of the lock pricing that reflects a .25% add on for LTV for a final locked rate of 6.125% at .25% discount points.  Review of the Loan Estimates does confirm the loan amount increase and justifies the increased pricing.  Condition cleared.

TRID Good Faith Tolerance
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Good Faith Violation: Fee Processing Fee provided on Final Closing Disclosure was not previously disclosed to the borrower. (817111)

Reviewer Comment (2016-04-25): Review of the file indicates that the initial Fee Sheet / CD dated 11/4/2015 provided by the title agent did not contain this fee and it appears lender became aware of the fee on 12/1/2015 which was after the final LE was issued.  Condition cleared.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-06): Nothing found for this exception.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure Demand Feature
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Loan Disclosures: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 12/16/2015 incorrectly disclosed whether the loan contains a Demand Feature. (Final/12/16/2015)
Actually, one of the prior CDs on 12/15/2015 incorrectly disclosed there was a demand feature on the loan, therefore causing all of the following CDs to appear to incorrectly disclose that there is not a demand feature.  The CD on 12/15/2015 showing there is a demand feature is the one that is incorrect.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure With Seller - Total Closing Costs Exceeds Limits
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Calculating Cash to Close: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 12/16/2015 disclosed an inaccurate value of the dollar amount by which the Total Closing Costs exceeded the legal limit. (Final/12/16/2015)
Final CD showed that the Total Other Costs Increase exceeds legal limits by $1579.77
51.62 months reserves > 3 months guideline minimum

691 representative FICO score > 640 guideline minimum

Borrower has a disposable income of $9313.69, which is > $4468.03 required
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-18): Review of the file reflects the title agent fees are listed in section C of the LE's, the SSPL reflects a title agent service provided and the CD's reflect title agent fees in section B incorrectly, however should be held to 10% tolerance not 0%.  Once included in 10% tolerance, 10% tolerance not exceeded and cure provided on the final CD is sufficient for 0% tolerance items.  Condition cured.


Seller Comment (2016-04-18): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 3/13/2016.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-16): Title fees are subject to 0% tolerance testing rather than 10% as vendor was not listed on SSPL but fees are listed in Section B after being listed in Section C on LEs.


Seller Comment (2016-03-16): Seller provided a 10% tolerance calculations to show that cure is sufficient for violations.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure With Seller - Total Closing Costs Exceeds Limits
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Calculating Cash to Close: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 12/12/2015 did not disclose the dollar amount by which the Total Closing Costs exceeded the legal limit. (Final/12/12/2015)
 
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-12): Cure documentation provided although is a sufficient cure amount, is outside the required 60 days of consummation and additionally discovery.


Seller Comment (2016-05-12): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 5/6/2016, letter to borrower, refund check and evidence of delivery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-19): using the LE dated 11/23/2015 as the baseline for the discount points.  While the initial CD dated 12/3/2015 does have higher points, the COC of a FICO score change was not valid and would not re-set the baseline and the CD was issued more than 4 days from the actual closing date.  In addition while an interim CD can be used for a rate lock (12/9/2015 CD), it cannot reset the baseline for fees.  CD in file signed by borrower does not list the appraisal fee in paid at close or paid prior to close so using $0 for baseline.  Both require tolerance cures.


Seller Comment (2016-04-19): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the product was changed from a Jumbo alt to HO Access on 12/9/2016 and re-locked at a pricing charge of .145% and was a valid COC for the redisclosed increased discount points and should be used as the baseline and that the CD provided 12/4/2015 was a title CD and not provided to the borrower so baseline for appraisal should be $500 with no tolerance cures needed.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-06): Original credit report in file is dated 9/28/2015 with a FICO score of 722 which matches the 1008 FICO score in the file, in addition, a valid COC on an initial CD is only allowed if less than 4 days from closing and initial CD with the change is greater than 4 days from closing.  Also, appraisal tolerance violated with no cure.


Seller Comment (2016-04-06): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the discount points were increased on the initial Closing Disclosure dated 12/03/2015 due to a FICO score change.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-11): Lender provided a Seller Closing Disclosure dated 12/9/2015; however, evidence of cure for tolerance violations provided to the borrower within 60 days of consummation along with corrected documentation was not provided.  Condition remains.


Seller Comment (2016-03-11): Lender provided a Seller Closing Disclosure dated 12/9/2015.

Reviewer Comment (2016-04-06): Review of the file reflects the purchase contract dated in 9/28/2015 indicates that the owner's policy is a seller paid fee and would be paid by the seller and is dated prior to the initial LE being issued.  Final CD reflects the fee paid by seller.  Condition cleared.


Seller Comment (2016-04-06): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that this is a seller paid fee and would not need to be a tolerance cure refund to the borrower.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-24): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the borrower did not choose their Settlement Service Provider from the SSPL provided, therefore the Owner's title policy premium does not fall within the 10% tolerance cure section.  However, no further documentation was provided to determine when lender became aware of the fee.


Seller Comment (2016-03-24): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the borrower did not choose their Settlement Service Provider from the SSPL provided, therefore the Owner's title policy premium does not fall within the 10% tolerance cure section.

TRID Zero Percent Tolerance Violation
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Zero Percent Fee Tolerance exceeded for Loan Discount Points.  Fee Amount of $614.80 exceeds tolerance of $85.00. (7200)
 
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-12): Cure documentation provided although is a sufficient cure amount, is outside the required 60 days of consummation and additionally discovery.


Seller Comment (2016-05-12): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 5/6/2016, letter to borrower, refund check and evidence of delivery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-19): Using the LE dated 11/23/2015 as the baseline for the discount points.  While the initial CD dated 12/3/2015 does have higher points, the COC of a FICO score change was not valid and would not re-set the baseline and the CD was issued more than 4 days from the actual closing date.  In addition while an interim CD can be used for a rate lock (12/9/2015 CD), it cannot reset the baseline for fees.


Seller Comment (2016-04-19): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the product was changed from a Jumbo alt to HO Access on 12/9/2016 and re-locked at a pricing charge of .145% and was a valid COC for the redisclosed increased discount points and should be used as the baseline.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-06): Incorrectly cured, should have only been commented by reviewer.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-06): The credit report in the file is dated 9/28/2015 and reflects a FICO score of 722 which is the FICO score reflected on the 1008 approved by the u/w and there are no further documentation to confirm a FICO score change between the credit report date and the COC.  In addition, the initial Closing Disclosure with the COC was greater than 4 days from close and would not reset the baseline from the last disclosed LE.  Condition remains.


Seller Comment (2016-04-06): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that there was a valid COC that the borrower's FICO score changed and the lock was updated to reflect a .50 pricing increase for the FICO score.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-24): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the DE dated 12/09/2015 disclosed a discount fee in the amount of $614.80 (0.145%) to borrower, this was a valid COC and was properly disclosed to the borrower, no tolerance cure required; however, the rate was locked on 11/19/2016 with a redisclosed LE dated 11/23/2015 and a lock through date of 12/21/2015 with a disclosed discount point amount of $85.  In addition, the CD dated 12/09/2015 is an interim CD and a COC would not be valid.


Seller Comment (2016-03-24): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the DE dated 12/09/2015 disclosed a discount fee in the amount of $614.80 (0.145%) to borrower, this was a valid COC and was properly disclosed to the borrower, no tolerance cure required.

Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-12): Cure documentation provided although is a sufficient cure amount, is outside the required 60 days of consummation and additionally discovery.


Seller Comment (2016-05-12): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 5/6/2016, letter to borrower, refund check and evidence of delivery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-19): There is a CD dated 12/4/2015 that is signed by the borrower on 12/12/2015 in the file on pg 34 & 47 of the original PDF.  This CD does not appear to be the same as the one you attached with the same date.  The CD does not list the appraisal fee accurately in either paid at close or prior to close and is the $0 baseline being used for the appraisal fee and the reason the 0% tolerance for this fee is failing.


Seller Comment (2016-04-19): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the CD dated 12/4/2015 was the settlement agent CD and was not provided to the borrower.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-24): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that all LE's and CD's disclosed the appraisal fee as $600 and no tolerance cure is required; however, the CD in the original file dated 12/04/2015 reflect no appraisal fee disclosed.  Lender provided a rebuttal on a different condition indicating that this CD was provided to title agent only and not borrower.  Please provide a loan level attestation that the CD in question was not provided to the borrower so the baseline for this fee can be reset and compliance rerun.

Seller Comment (2016-05-12): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 5/6/2016, letter to borrower, refund check and evidence of delivery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-19): using the LE dated 11/23/2015 as the baseline for the discount points.  While the initial CD dated 12/3/2015 does have higher points, the COC of a FICO score change was not valid and would not re-set the baseline and the CD was issued more than 4 days from the actual closing date.  In addition while an interim CD can be used for a rate lock (12/9/2015 CD), it cannot reset the baseline for fees.  CD in file signed by borrower does not list the appraisal fee in paid at close or paid prior to close so using $0 for baseline.  Both require tolerance cures.

Insufficient Coverage: Hazard insurance coverage amount is insufficient.

Reviewer Comment (2016-04-14): Insurance coverage is sufficient for insurance agent rebuild cost estimate.  Condition cleared.


Seller Comment (2016-04-14): Lender provided the insurance agent's cost estimator for rebuild cost of $478,394.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-22): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the HOI has sufficient coverage as it contains guaranteed replacement costs; however, the policy does indicate replacement costs and extended replacement costs but does not indicate guaranteed replacement costs as required per the guidelines and the dwelling coverage and extended replacement cost does not cover the cost new per appraisal or loan amount and there is no cost to rebuild estimate used by the insurance agent found in the file to verify sufficient coverage.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure Summaries Of Transactions - Deposit
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Summaries of Transactions: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 12/19/2015 did not disclose the Deposit. (Final/12/19/2015)
The $100,000 deposit reflected in "Calculating Cash to Close" is not reflected in "Summaries of Transactions".
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-05-03): Lender cured with post consummation CD correctly reflecting the deposit.


Seller Comment (2016-05-03): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 4/24/2016.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-27): Based on review of the file and the lender's rebuttal it appears the deposit amount is $2K; however, the Closing Disclosures still incorrectly reflect this deposit on line 08 of the Summaries of Transaction table versus the correct line of 01 in section L and does not reflect any deposit in the Calculating Cash to Close table.  These amounts should be correctly listed and match.


Seller Comment (2016-04-27): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that they disagree regarding the $100K deposit and that this amount was not previously deposited by the borrower, per the closing package confirms the deposit amount as $2K.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-14): The issue is that the Calculating Cash to Close table reflects a deposit of $100K, and the Summaries of Transaction incorrectly reflects the Deposit on line 08 versus line 01 and the amount of $2K does not match the deposit reflected in the Calculating Cash to Close table.


Seller Comment (2016-04-14): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the EMD was reflected on the contract as $2K, and provided a snip of that portion of the contract as well as a snip of the CD Summaries of Transaction which reflects the EMD on line 08 under adjustments for $2K.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-22): EMD reflected as $2000, per Calculating Cash to Close borrower deposit is $100,000.


Seller Comment (2016-03-22): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the $100,000 deposit reflected on page 3 between EM on L08 and the Cash to Close from the borrower of $97,060.70.  This included adjustments and credit applied prior to closing.

TRID Interim Closing Disclosure Summaries Of Transactions - Deposit
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Summaries of Transactions: Closing Disclosure provided on 12/16/2015 did not disclose the Deposit. (Initial/12/16/2015)
The $100,000 deposit reflected in "Calculating Cash to Close" is not reflected in "Summaries of Transactions".
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-05-03): Lender cured with post consummation CD correctly reflecting the deposit.


Seller Comment (2016-05-03): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 4/24/2016.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-27): Based on review of the file and the lender's rebuttal it appears the deposit amount is $2K; however, the Closing Disclosures still incorrectly reflect this deposit on line 08 of the Summaries of Transaction table versus the correct line of 01 in section L and does not reflect any deposit in the Calculating Cash to Close table.  These amounts should be correctly listed and match.


Seller Comment (2016-04-27): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that they disagree regarding the $100K deposit and that this amount was not previously deposited by the borrower, per the closing package confirms the deposit amount as $2K.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-14): The issue is that the Calculating Cash to Close table reflects a deposit of $100K, and the Summaries of Transaction incorrectly reflects the Deposit on line 08 versus line 01 and the amount of $2K does not match the deposit reflected in the Calculating Cash to Close table.


Seller Comment (2016-04-14): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the EMD was reflected on the contract as $2K, and provided a snip of that portion of the contract as well as a snip of the CD Summaries of Transaction which reflects the EMD on line 08 under adjustments for $2K.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-22): EMD reflected as $2000, per Calculating Cash to Close borrower deposit is $100,000.


Seller Comment (2016-03-22): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the $100,000 estimated down payment is reflected on pg 3 between EM on L08 and the Cash to Close from the borrower of $97,060.70 and includes adjustments and credits applied prior to and at closing.

TRID Interim Closing Disclosure Timing
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Interim Closing Disclosure was not received by the borrower at least three (3) business days prior to consummation.
Loan closed on <redacted> but CDs were issued on 12/19/2015, 12/22/2015 and 12/24/2015
20.13 months reserves > 3 months guideline minimum

Borrower has a disposable income of $4190.58, which is > $2472.17 required
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-25): The issue is timing and no evidence of borrower receive of 12/22/2015 CD at lease 3 days prior to closing was provided.


Seller Comment (2016-04-25): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the initial CD dated 12/19/2015 sent to the borrower had a loan amount of $226K and fees paid by borrower, re-disclosed CD dated 12/23/2015 was a COC CD due to loan amount change >$234K and fees being changed from paid by borrower to paid by seller.  These changes would cause the APR to decrease  and the finance charge to increase.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-25): This violation is triggered by the 12/22 CD which reflects an APR that decreased by .21%, and a finance charge that increased by $5,711.70.


Seller Comment (2016-03-25): 3/8/16 Lender states The CD from 12/19/2015 was signed by the borrower on 12/19/2015 so the earliest consummation date was  12/23/2015.  Any subsequent disclosures did not have any of the below triggering events to begin a new three day count: a) APR Increased by .125 or more (decreases do not trigger the count);  2) The Loan product changes which includes product amortization or payment attribute change.  For example a Fixed loan going to an ARM loan or Full P&I to Interest Only.  (any other changes where amortization or payment attribute change); 3)  If a Prepayment Penalty is added.  (Seller currently does not offer programs with Pre-payment penalties).

Reviewer Comment (2016-04-29): Lender provided cure documentation provided is a sufficient cure amount; however, provided over 60 days from consummation.


Seller Comment (2016-04-29): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 4/27/2016, letter to borrower and evidence of delivery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-28): Post consummation CD provided by lender has a lender credit that matches the previous lender credit and an additional tolerance cure; however, the letter to the borrower, refund check and evidence of delivery was not provided and is outside the required 60 days from consummation.


Seller Comment (2016-04-28): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 4/27/2016 that reflects a lender credit of $19,166.72 which includes a tolerance cure of $15,546.60 and also lender paid fees of $27,672.68 for a total lender credit of $31,292.80 and cure of $15,546.60.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-25): Lender credit in summaries of transaction is in incorrectly placed in the wrong section of the CD and should be reflected on page 2 as lender paid with the total lender credit on pg 2 to equal $31,292.80.


Seller Comment (2016-04-25): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the lender credit was $31,292.80 which includes the lender paid fees on pg 2 which total $27,672.68 and the lender paid HOI credit on page 3 in summaries of transaction for $3,620.12.

TRID Zero Percent Tolerance Violation
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Zero Percent Fee Tolerance exceeded for Loan Origination Fee.  Fee Amount of $27,921.00 exceeds tolerance of $.00. (7325)
 
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-19): Review of the file and lender's rebuttal reflects that there are 2 CD's in file dated 12/30/2015; however, one has no discount points and  origination fee of $27,921 and one has discount points of $27,921 with no origination fee.  All LE's and all remaining CD's outside the 1 has origination fee of $27,921.  Appears to be a terminology issue which would be cured with the final CD with the correct verbiage.  This condition cleared and exception set for terminology.


Seller Comment (2016-04-19): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the 2 CD's dated 12/30/2015 in the file reflect the origination fee at $27,921.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-13): Review of the file reflects there were 2 CD's issued on 12/30/2015, the on pg 61 of the PDF reflect no loan origination fee so $0 is being used as a baseline.


Seller Comment (2016-04-13): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the Loan Origination Fee of $27,921 was reflected on the initial LE and all subsequent LE's and CD's and was the amount charged at closing.  No cure is needed for this fee.

RESPA 2010 GFE vs HUD Block 1
RESPA (2010): 0% tolerance violation for 801 fee without evidence of sufficient cure provided.
Assignment fee to a financial institution related to the Seller was included on the HUD but did not appear anywhere else in file.  Fee is paid by lender and appears to be a Yield spread fee, however no documentation to verify.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-01): 3rd part fee paid POC and not a tolerance issue.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-18): Please provide evidence of what services were provided by payee of the assignment fee or what it was intended to pay?  As it currently stands the fee appears to violate section 8 of RESPA.


Seller Comment (2016-04-18): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the since the assignment fee was paid POC by the lender it doesn't factor in to the costs to close at all and would not be required to be disclosed unless it is being charged to the borrower or calculated into the closing costs.

There was no annual Homeowners Insurance premium disclosed on the final LE
6.64 months reserves > 3 months guideline minimum

Borrower has a disposable income of $6118.09, which is > $2770.51 minimum required

Low LTV of 61.43%
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-29): Lender provided attestation that fee was discovered during the Final CD review and collaboration with the settlement agent.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-13): Review of the file does confirm that the HOi was on the initial and then re-disclosed LE for 10 months under prepaids; however, subsequent re-disclosed LE's no longer reflect HOI under prepaids and only reflect 2 months collected for escrows.  Please provide further details on why the fee was removed on subsequent LE's and when lender determined the fee was required again prior to the initial CD.


Seller Comment (2016-04-13): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the HOI was disclosed on the LE dated 11/05/2015 in the prepaids section for 10 months based on the due date of the premium and was reflected on the initial CD dated 12/16/2015 for 12 months due to closing date of 1/6 and due date of HOI of 4/2016.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-23): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 3/13/2016 that reflects the Homeowner's Insurance Premium.  No further documentation was provided to determine when lender became aware of the fee.

Reviewer Comment (2016-04-27): Based on lender attestation, lender became aware of the borrower attorney fee after the final LE had been issued.  Condition cleared.


Seller Comment (2016-04-27): Lender provided an attestation that they became aware of the fee on 12/15/2015.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-25): Review of lender's attestation and rebuttal reflects that the attorney fee lender is referring to is the title agent attorney fee, the exception in question is for the borrower's attorney fee in section H - Other.  If the intention is to indicate that they were both included in section C then an exception for incorrect terminology and fee in incorrect section would need to be added.  Please advise.


Seller Comment (2016-04-25): Lender provided an attestation that they became aware of the attorney's fee on 11/5/2015 and that it was disclosed on the LE dated 11/5/2015 and attached a snip of section C of the LE.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-24): While this fee is not subject to tolerance testing, it is subject to Good Faith testing.  Missing evidence of when/how Lender came to know that the fee would be paid.


Seller Comment (2016-03-24): 3/18/16 Lender states Buyer's attorney fee is in a section that can be shopped for and is not subject to a tolerance.  CFPB does not require curative measures for this item.

TRID Tolerance Violation without Cure
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Tolerance violation without evidence of sufficient cure provided.
 
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-03-17): Needed to be cleared not cured.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-17): Lender asked for clarification on the exception - calculation.  Review of the file reflects the Title - Search had no prior baseline and was charged to the Seller at closing for $250.  The title search fee in FL is typically a Seller fee and was paid by the Seller.  Not including this fee, the 10% tolerance is not exceeded.  Also, loan discount per rate lock was $1971.20 rounded down to $1971 on the LE; however, the final Closing Disclosure cure of $776.80 is sufficient based on the unrounded discount points.  Condition cleared.


Seller Comment (2016-03-17): Lender asked for clarification on the associated exception - calculation.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure With Seller - Total Closing Costs Exceeds Limits

DTI: Max allowed 43% Actual 37%

Residual Income:  Required $4425.18  Actual $7990.10
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-16): Documents provided reflect a sufficient cure; however are outside the required 60 days of consummation (and discovery).


Seller Comment (2016-05-16): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 5/2/2016, letter to the borrower, refund check and evidence of delivery (FEDEX slip with sent date of 5/13/2016).


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-19): While the program/rate lock change requires the lender to provide the borrower with a re-disclosed CD reflecting the accurate terms before closing, an interim CD cannot reset the baseline for fees.  Using the initial CD as the baseline the 0% tolerance is exceeded by $222.58.


Seller Comment (2016-04-19): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that change of the program is a valid COC and a CD COC is always going to be after the initial CD and that revised rebuttals had been previously sent and there are no tolerance violations.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-11): Lender provided documentation reflects borrower requested program change from 30 yr fixed to 5/1 ARM with no rate lock expiration and a discount point increase from .09 to .145 for the same interest rate as a 30 yr fixed, in addition, this change happened after the initial CD was issued and is not a valid COC due to after initial CD provided.


Seller Comment (2016-04-11): Lender provided a copy of their lock transaction history, a copy of the pricing and an explanation that the borrower changed their product on 12/14/2016 from a 30 year fixed to a 5/1 ARM.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-17): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 3/13/2016, a GFE tolerance comparison worksheet, a copy of the interim Closing Disclosure dated 12/14/2015 as well as a rate lock dated 12/14/2015.  Review of the file finds that the loan was locked on 12/04/2015 with a rate lock through 1/4/2016 and discount points of $364, the initial Closing Disclosure was provided to the borrower on 12/09/2015 with discount points of $364, an interim Closing Disclosure was provided on 12/14/2015 with discount points of $586.58 along with a rate lock dated 12/14/2015 and a COC form dated 12/14/2015 indicating borrower requested program change.  However, after initial Closing Disclosure was provided and no COC is allowed and the COC provided would not be sufficient to justify a valid COC.  Condition remains.


Seller Comment (2016-03-17): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 3/13/2016, a GFE tolerance comparison worksheet, a copy of the interim Closing Disclosure dated 12/14/2015 as well as a rate lock dated 12/14/2015.

Borrower has a disposable income of $12,939.48, which is > $4375.53 minimum required
Reviewer Comment (2016-03-18): Lender provided a rebuttal and GFE tolerance worksheet that reflects no tolerance cure needed.  Review of the file reflects that the title fees were reflected in Section C of the LE and the settlement fee and lender's title insurance were moved to section B on the CD's and the title agent is not listed as a service provider on the Lender's service provider list but a settlement service provider is listed so title fees in section B should be subject to 10% tolerance.  Moving those fees to the 10% tolerance category the 10% tolerance is not exceeded.  Condition cleared; however, condition being added for fees in wrong section (should be in C).

Reviewer Comment (2016-04-25): Based on lender attestation, they became aware of this separate fee on 1/21/2016 and based on prior lender attestation it appears the believed the fee to be only property taxes; however, per the initial CD dated 1/15/2016 the fee for city property taxes which indicates lender was aware of the fee prior to 1/21/2016.


Seller Comment (2016-04-25): Lender provided an attestation that they became aware of the separate city tax escrow on 1/21/2016 during the CD review process with the closing agent.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure With Seller - Total Closing Costs Exceeds Limits
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Calculating Cash to Close: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 1/20/2016 disclosed an inaccurate value of the dollar amount by which the Total Closing Costs exceeded the legal limit. (Final/01/20/2016)
Tolerance cure reflected as only $150 for CDA cure; however, based on 1/14/2016 interim Closing Disclosure the credit report also has a 0% tolerance excess of $26.16 and the recording fee has a 10% tolerance excess of $3.08 which no cure was provided.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-25): Although cure amount is sufficient it was not provided within 60 days of consummation or discovery.


Seller Comment (2016-05-25): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 5/17/2016, letter to the borrower, refund check and evidence of delivery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-20): The cure documentation provided by lender is not sufficient, the additional cure for the credit report fee was not included.  The CD dated 1/14/2016 that lender indicates was provided by the correspondent is still a valid CD as it is executed by borrower therefore provided to borrower and reset the baseline for this fee.  In addition, the cure provided for the 10% tolerance is outside the required 60 days of consummation.


Seller Comment (2016-04-20): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 4/11/2016, a copy of the letter to the borrower a refund check and evidence of delivery.  Lender also provided a rebuttal that the credit report fee had no 0% tolerance violation and that the CD's dated 1/14/2016 were not provided by lender but were provided by the correspondent.

Final Closing Disclosure reflects 12/28/2015.  Notary signature date on Mortgage is 12/30/2015.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-05-03): Post consummation CD provided by lender reflects the correct closing date.  Condition cured.


Seller Comment (2016-05-03): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 4/18/2016, letter to borrower and evidence of delivery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-25): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the subject state is not a date sensitive state - the documents do Not have to be signed on the same day they are generated.  However, the CD is required to reflect the correct disbursement date, which it does, subject state is a wet funding state; however, the issue date on the final Closing Disclosure is not in question, the Closing date needs to reflect the date of consummation per TRID regulation and this would be the notary date on the mortgage for this transaction.  The lender is required to provide a post consummation Closing Disclosure once the correct closing date is known.


Seller Comment (2016-03-25): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the subject state is not a date sensitive state - the documents do Not have to be signed on the same day they are generated.  However, the CD is required to reflect the correct disbursement date, which it does, subject state is a wet funding state.

TRID Tolerance Violation without Cure
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Tolerance violation without evidence of sufficient cure provided.
$1 cure required for Discount Points 0% tolerance.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-27): Cure documentation provided by lender is a sufficient cure; however, is outside the required 60 days from consummation.


Seller Comment (2016-04-27): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 4/24/2016 with a tolerance cure of $1, letter to the borrower, refund check and evidence of delivery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-20): Lender COC is not valid as an error in the decimal point places is not a valid COC.  A valid change of circumstance must fall into one of the following categories per 12 CFR 1026.19(e)(3)(iv):
(A) Changed Circumstance affecting settlement charges;
(B) Changed Circumstance affecting eligibility;
(C) Revisions requested by the consumer;
(D) Interest Rate Dependent Charges; 
(E) Expiration; or
(F) Delayed settlement on a construction loan.


Seller Comment (2016-04-20): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating the finding is invalid and that the COC dated 1/13/2016 is valid although there wasn't a change to the rate, there was a change/adjustment to the borrower's interest rate lock.  Lender also provided a copy of the lock history which reflects a change in lock criteria on 1/13/2016.  Lender also provided a rebuttal indicating that the 1/12/2016 LE did not disclose the discount points percentage carried out three decimal places.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-13): COC provided by lender is not consistent with the documentation in the file.  The LE dated 1/12/2016 was the initial lock and reflects a rate of 7.375% with discount points of $2,840 locked through 2/10, the re-disclosed LE dated 1/13/2016 reflects rate at 7.375% with discount points of $2,841 locked through 2/10.  The loan closed at a rate of 7.375%.  There was no change in rate associated with the discount point increase of $1 and no valid COC was found for the increase.


Seller Comment (2016-04-13): Lender provided a COC that indicates rate lock change, rate from 6.75 to 6.5 with a pricing change from 2840 to 2841.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-21): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that there is no tolerance for 0% or 10% category and provided a GFE comparison for tolerances and used the most recently disclosed LE.  However, the loan was locked on the LE dated 1/12/2016 and discount points indicated as $2840, re-disclosed and final LE dated 1/13/2016 reflects discount points as $2841 but COC indicates lock; however, loan was previously locked and corresponding COC for 1/13/2016 is not valid.  Using most recent valid LE on 1/12/2016 discount points tolerance exceeded by $1.


Seller Comment (2016-03-21): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that there is no tolerance for 0% or 10% category and provided a GFE comparison for tolerances and used the most recently disclosed LE.

Reviewer Comment (2016-04-13): COC provided by lender is not consistent with the documentation in the file.  The LE dated 1/12/2016 was the initial lock and reflects a rate of 7.375% with discount points of $2,840 locked through 2/10, the re-disclosed LE dated 1/13/2016 reflects rate at 7.375% with discount points of $2,841 locked through 2/10.  The loan closed at a rate of 7.375%.  There was no change in rate associated with the discount point increase of $1 and no valid COC was found for the increase.


Seller Comment (2016-04-13): Lender provided a COC that indicates rate lock change, rate from 6.75 to 6.5 with a pricing change from 2840 to 2841.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-21): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that there is no tolerance for 0% or 10% category and provided a GFE comparison for tolerances and used the most recently disclosed LE.  However, the loan was locked on the LE dated 1/12/2016 and discount points indicated as $2840, re-disclosed and final LE dated 1/13/2016 reflects discount points as $2841 but COC indicates lock; however, loan was previously locked and corresponding COC for 1/13/2016 is not valid.  Using most recent valid LE on 1/12/2016 discount points tolerance exceeded by $1.


Seller Comment (2016-03-21): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that there is no tolerance for 0% or 10% category and provided a GFE comparison for tolerances and used the most recently disclosed LE.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure With Seller - Total Closing Costs Exceeds Limits
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Calculating Cash to Close: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 1/22/2016 disclosed an inaccurate value of the dollar amount by which the Total Closing Costs exceeded the legal limit. (Final/01/22/2016)
Lender provided a cure for $345.70 which is insufficient, a total required cure is $1,749.74.  The lender did not provide a valid COC for the increase in discount point fees from locked Loan Estimate dated 12/15/2015 to same locked re-disclosed Loan Estimate dated 12/21/2015.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-03-28): Review of the file reflects that the credit report indicates the mortgage was included in BK and the BK docs in the file are from 2011/2012.  However, a letter provided to the borrower and additional third party documentation provided after initial rate lock reflects that although the property was included in BK, the foreclosure itself did not take place until 5/2105 which would have been in the last 12 months and represents a valid COC for change in eligibility.  Using the 12/21/2015 LE as a baseline, discount point shortage was cured on the final Closing Disclosure and 0% & 10% tolerances all with sufficient cure.  Condition cleared.


Seller Comment (2016-03-28): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating the the final Closing Disclosure contained a sufficient cure for 0% & 10% tolerances.

The lender did not provide a valid COC for the increase in discount point fees from locked Loan Estimate dated 12/15/2015 to same locked re-disclosed Loan Estimate dated 12/21/2015.  The COC provided indicates only Change to borrower's interest rate lock which is not a valid COC to justify the increase in fees.

Seller Comment (2016-03-28): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the 12/21/2016 re-disclosure and increased discount points was due to a valid COC due to change in eligibility.  Lender provided a copy of the lock history with an explanation that the borrower had an previously unknown housing event <12 months which increased the pricing.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure With Seller - Total Closing Costs Exceeds Limits
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Calculating Cash to Close: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 1/25/2016 disclosed an inaccurate value of the dollar amount by which the Total Closing Costs exceeded the legal limit. (Final/01/25/2016)
CD page 3 reflects exceeded legal limits by $730.71, however the accurate figure would be $854.21 as a result of the increase in lender's title insurance, recording fees, and credit report fee.  Lender paid portion of settlement fee is not allowed to be included in tolerance testing.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-05-16): Review of the file reflects the baseline for the settlement fee should be $2,650 as disclosed on the most recent valid LE and that using that baseline the 10% tolerance and credit report tolerance was cured on the final CD with a tolerance cure of $730.71.


Seller Comment (2016-05-16): Lender provided a rebuttal that the baseline for the settlement fee should be $2,650 and that the cure provided is a sufficient cure for the credit report and 10% tolerance violation.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-11): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the calculated cure should be $693.66 and that the original tolerance cure amount applied at closing of $730.71 so no further liability to assignee.  Actual calculated cure is $854.21 with credit report baseline initial LE was $0 and 10% baseline of lender's title insurance and recording from initial CD.  Condition remains.

Borrower's account #2020 shows a deposit of $36,500 on 12/16/2015. Documentation provided to document source of deposit was title for a truck purchased on 10/20/2015 and does not reflect a lienholder. The vehicle was sold to the borrower's employer per bill of sale (p 394-396) for $36,500. A printout from KBB was provided (p382) that indicates the value of the vehicle was $34,481.  File contains a bank statement from #2020 from 10/17/2015 to 11/17/2015 (p397) that does not show the $36,500 used to purchase this vehicle. This was not an arms-length transaction and the employer appears to have paid more than the value of the truck.
 
Seller Comment (2016-02-25): Received an LOE regarding this large deposit and sale of the truck - UW can't dictate the terms of a sale of a personal asset.  Yes, the person that bought the truck was a co-worker, but that does not make this a non-arms length transaction.  The bill of sale of the deposit amount match, therefore explaining the large deposit.  Reviewer agrees.  Issue cleared.

Seller Comment (2016-04-12): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 3/31/2016 with a tolerance cure of $506.


Seller Comment (2016-03-15): Seller states cure provided is sufficient for tolerance violations.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-15): Total Cure Required:  $506 - $47 for Credit Report, $450 for Appraisal, and $9 for the Recording Fee ($120 disclosed * 110% = $132; Fee of $141 on final CD).  $450 + $47 + $9 = $506.  $503 cure reflected, so cure is short by $3.

Document Error
Loan Estimate Error:  Loan Estimate(s) does not reflect that the interest rate locked prior to closing.
 
None of the LE's in file show that the rate was ever locked.
100.75 months reserves > 6 months guideline minimum

777 representative FICO score > 660 guideline minimum
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-12): Based on the documentation provided it appears the rate lock was on 12/11/2015, the initial CD is dated 12/14/2015 with a close date of 12/17/2015.  Lender had three days after rate lock to re-disclose; however, at the end of the three days lender wasn't able to provide an LE 4 days prior to expected consummation.  Rate lock reflected on CD is sufficient due to timing.  Condition cleared.


Seller Comment (2016-04-12): Lender provided a rebuttal and a copy of the rate lock reflecting the borrower opted to lock the rate on 12/11/2015 as well as provided a snip of the TRID regs regarding lock requirements.

TRID Zero Percent Tolerance Violation
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Zero Percent Fee Tolerance exceeded for Appraisal Fee.  Fee Amount of $600.00 exceeds tolerance of $550.00. (7506)
 
100.75 months reserves > 6 months guideline minimum

777 representative FICO score > 660 guideline minimum
Reviewer Comment (2016-03-25): 0% tolerance was cured on final CD


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-25): Total Cure provided on final CD $2,937.20 is insufficient to cure the $3300.20 total tolerance violation.  0% tolerance = $200 and 10% tolerance = $3,100.20. Baseline is 12/7 LE with these 10% fees:  Settlement $300, Endorsement $0, Lender's Title $100, Recording $138, and Courier $0 = $538.00.  The 10% fees reflected on the final CD = $3,692.   10% tolerance calculation = $3,692 - ($538 + $53.80) = $3,100.20.  Missing cure for $363 (deadline for cure is 3/27/16).


Seller Comment (2016-03-25): 3/18/16 Seller states This is an invalid finding.  The Total Exceed Limit of $2,937.20 is accurate based on 0% and 10% tolerance calculations.  Please see 0% and 10% Tolerance Comparison Table below from Seller's Loan Operating System (LOS): $200 zero percent excess + $2,737.20 ten percent excess = $2,937.20.  This figure matches the Final CD dated 1/27/16.

Miscellaneous
Compliance Exception:
 
CD is missing breakdown of payoff's paid through closing. Requires documentation that Fidelity, Chase and Kohl's debts were retired at settlement.  Only shows total that was paid off, no break down of actual debts that were paid.
100.75 months reserves > 6 months guideline minimum

777 representative FICO score > 660 guideline minimum
Reviewer Comment (2016-05-19): Final CD reflects lump sum payoffs in Summaries section, however did not reflect them in Calculating Cash to Close section.  3/7 post-close CD reflects the total lump sum in Summaries and the amount in Calculating.  3/31 post-close CD reflects itemized "revolving" and "installment" payoffs, however does not itemize the payees. These are not liens, but consumer debt.  Cured - this is TRID compliant on both post-close CDs, and is within 60 days of discovery (2/19).


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-25): Payoffs have now been separately identified.  The violation remains for omitting the payoff figures from the Calculating Cash To Close section.  There is no prescribed cure for this violation.


Seller Comment (2016-03-25): 3/18/16 Lender states Please be advised that Seller's LOS currently only supports the lump sum figure to be shown on the CD.  However, here is a screenshot of the accounts in question (Fidelity $21,798, Chase Card $15,753, Comenity Bank/Pottery Barn $182).

TRID Lender Credit Tolerance
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - 0% tolerance violation:  Lender credit was decreased resulting in increased charge to borrower.
Was $795 on the CD dated 1/20/16 and was decreased to $0 on the final CD.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-27): Lender explains that the reason for the decrease in credit was due to the removal of the third party processing fee of $795 that was never charged to the borrower at closing; however, per the post consummation CD dated 3/12/2016 the third party processing fee was removed and the lender credit was $842.50, the post consummation CD dated 4/2/2016 and corresponding cure documentation also reflects no third party processing fee of $795 but only has a cure of $428.50.


Seller Comment (2016-04-27): Lender provided the same rebuttal that was already provided.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-12): The documentation provided is outside the 60 day consummation requirement and a prior post consummation CD provided dated 3/12/2016 had a higher lender cure amount and no explanation was provided on why amount was reduced on most recent post consummation CD dated 4/2/2016.  Lender did provide an explanation that the initial CD lender cure credit was for a third party processing fee and that fee and cure were both removed from final CD.


Seller Comment (2016-04-12): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 4/2/2016 with a tolerance cure of $428.50, a copy of the letter to the borrower, refund check and evidence of delivery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-15): 3/15/16 Lender provided Post-Close CD dated 3/12/16, reflecting a credit/cure of $842.50 (though missing Letter of Explanation, Refund to Borrower and proof of delivery (must be dated within 60 days of Close)).  The Lender Credit 0% tolerance violation $795 + other 0% tolerance violations $296.50, would result in a needed cure of $1091.50.


Seller Comment (2016-03-15): 3/14/16 Lender provided Post-Close CD dated 3/12/16.

Transfer taxes on LE $3,800, total transfer taxes on CD $7,177.50.  Only $100 cure reflected on CD.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-12): Review of the file reflects that the most recent valid LE has buyer side transfer taxes disclosed as $3,800, review of the contract in the file indicates that per MD section 14-104 of the Real Property Article,unless otherwise negotiated in the contract or provided by state or local law, the cost of all transfer taxes shall be shared equally between buyer/seller.  Based on this, the buyer portion of the total transfer taxes would be $3,588.75 and is below the baseline of $3,800.  Condition cleared.

TRID Zero Percent Tolerance Violation
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Zero Percent Fee Tolerance exceeded for Transfer Tax.  Fee Amount of $7,177.50 exceeds tolerance of $3,800.00. (8304)
Transfer taxes on LE $3,800, total transfer taxes on CD $7,177.50 which includes the $1,645 of City/County Taxes. Only $100 cure reflected on CD.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-12): Review of the file reflects that the most recent valid LE has buyer side transfer taxes disclosed as $3,800, review of the contract in the file indicates that per MD section 14-104 of the Real Property Article,unless otherwise negotiated in the contract or provided by state or local law, the cost of all transfer taxes shall be shared equally between buyer/seller.  Based on this, the buyer portion of the total transfer taxes would be $3,588.75 and is below the baseline of $3,800.  Condition cleared.


Seller Comment (2016-04-12): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the transfer taxes were disclosed on the LE's and were ultimately paid solely by seller along with a copy of the contract addendum which indicates seller will pay all transfer taxes.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-28): Seller provided a rebuttal indicating that the fee in question is a seller paid fee per the final CD; however, in the state of Maryland transfer taxes are typically paid by the borrower and although paid by seller should have been disclosed since it is a borrower required fee.


Seller Comment (2016-03-28): Seller provided a rebuttal indicating that the fee in question is a seller paid fee per the final CD.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-11): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the difference in transfer taxes is seller paid so no cure is needed; however, transfer taxes in MD are typically buyer paid fees and would need to be included in the tolerance calculation.  Condition remains.


Seller Comment (2016-03-11): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the difference in transfer taxes is seller paid so no cure is needed.

TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - General Information: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 1/25/2016 disclosed an Appraised Property Value that did not match the actual Property Value for the loan. (Final/01/25/2016)

Max allowed DTI of 43% and actual DTI is 38%

Max allowed LTV of 70% and actual LTV of 35%
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-04): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 4/1/2016 that reflects the appraised property value of $354,000.  Condition cured.


Seller Comment (2016-04-04): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 4/1/2016 that reflects the appraised property value of $354,000.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-22): Although the prior sales price being used for property owned less than 12 months is required by guidelines for qualifying purposes, the Closing Disclosure value must be the appraised value.


Seller Comment (2016-03-22): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the property was acquired less than 12 months prior, so they used the acquisition cost of $331,979 and the CD is accurate based on the above and lender would not use the actual appraised value in this scenario.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure Homeowner's Insurance Premium Months
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Other Costs: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 1/29/2016 disclosed homeowner's insurance under Prepaids that does not match amount per month calculation. (Final/01/29/2016)
Monthly charge for homeowner's insurance disclosed as 342.75 in section G of CD. Section F collected 12 months insurance premium of $2,056.00.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-12): Based on the information provided by the lender it appears the difference is due to the invoice amount already paid being rounded to whole numbers and the amount still due while not perfectly half is rounded by the insurance carrier and is $1 less for the remaining 6 months which make the post consummation correction to 6 months accurate and the monthly amount accurate.  Condition cured.


Seller Comment (2016-04-12): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the HOI annual premium is $4113/12 = $342.75 monthly and per the HOI invoice $2,057 was paid leaving a balance of $2056.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-25): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 3/12/2016 that reflects the HOI prepaids as 6 months versus 12 months; however, monthly amount still not accurate.  Not a defined cure within TRID regulation.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure Total Of Payments
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Loan Calculations: Final Closing Disclosure provided on  1/5/2016 disclosed a Total of Payments that does not match the actual total of payments for the loan. (Final/01/05/2016)
Unclear of the method used by the lender to disclose this loan.  It appears they may have used an incorrect Index rate and rendered an incorrect fully indexed rate of 7.750 in place of 7.625.  However, unlike other loans in which they included the seller paid fees on the CD in the TOP calculation, the  only seller paid fee included for this loan was the prepaid interest.  (It is possible there are alternative methods employed by the lender to yield this result, but their calculation did not follow their described methodology.

Reviewer Comment (2016-05-16): Post consummation CD provided reflects a TOP of $513,783.21 which matches the calculated TOP within allowed tolerance; however, cure provided outside the required 60 days of discovery.

Seller Comment (2016-05-13): Client provided review under 130(b)


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-26): Sufficient cure documentation provided; however, over 60 days from consummation.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-12): The cure provided is insufficient, the lender justifies using the initial CD COC by indicating that the loan was supposed to close on 1/28/2016 per the contract; however, even using that date, the CD was provided >4 days prior to closing and is not a valid COC.  The lender should have provided the borrower with the corrected re-disclosed LE not CD.  Condition remains for insufficient cure, and the remaining cures were provided over 60 days from consummation.

Reviewer Comment (2016-03-16): 3/16/16 Initial CD was issued > 4 days prior to closing.  Therefore, the baseline was not reset.  $3,310.56 Loan Discount was added on 1/21 CD,  $150 CDA was added on 2/3 CD, and $949 Admin Fee was added on 1/21 CD.  Missing cure of $4,409.56.

Reviewer Comment (2016-04-26): Review of the file reflects based on the lender's expected closing date, the disclosure of the lock on the initial CD was a valid COC and the increased discount points due to rate lock is allowed.  Condition cleared.


Seller Comment (2016-04-26): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the reason for disclosing the lock details for this transaction in lieu of a re-disclosed LE is the borrower chose to lock their rate on 1/20/2016, the lock details were disclosed on the initial CD in order to meet the closing date of 1/28/2016.  Disclosing the lock details on a re-disclosed LE would have caused additional delays and the closing was scheduled for 1/28/2016.

Reviewer Comment (2016-04-11): Lender attestation states CD in question was not provided to the borrower.  Condition cleared.


Seller Comment (2016-04-11): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the CD in question was provided by the title agent to the lender as a fee sheet and was not intended to or provided to the borrower.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-15): 3/14/16 Lender provided another copy of the Initial CD.  This does not appear to address the issue of the partially incomplete CD that we've tested using a tentative issue date of 12/31/15.  The violation remains.


Seller Comment (2016-03-15): 3/14/16 Lender provided another copy of the Initial CD.

TRID Closing Disclosure Total Closing Costs Exceeds Limits Amount
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Calculating Cash to Close: Closing Disclosure provided on 12/31/2015 disclosed a tolerance cure amount that does not match the amount disclosed in the Other Costs table. (Interim/12/31/2015)
Calculating Cash to Close does not reflect a cure tolerance.  Cost to Close Table reflects $198.30.  Note: CD does not have an issue date using estimated date of 12/31/2015 for tentative testing.

TRID non-compliant: Fees were not reflected in the correct section of the disclosure.
 
Title fees are reflected in section C of the LE's and section B of the CD's; however, the title agent is not reflected on the Service Provider List provided to the borrower and should have remained in section C.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-10): Nothing further was provided.


Seller Comment (2016-05-10): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the CD's are hard coded to have the RESPA credit read as a positive number, however have the description read as "credit" and is calculated as a credit, lender reviewed the CFPB guide and indicates they could not locate any guidance which states that the lender credit must be reflected as a negative number.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-22): Seller provided a copy of an executed Confirmation of Decision to Shop for Services in which the borrower indicates they choose not to shop and to allow lender to select the appropriate Title Agent and executed on 11/5/2015.  However, the file contains a Our Selection of Service Provider executed by the borrower with no date that indicates they chose the indicated Service provider and the SSPL in the file dated 11/4/2015 that does not reflect the title agent listed on the Closing Disclosure.  The LE indicates the borrower could shop for services based on the title fees in section C; however, it it is determined that the borrower was not allowed to shop for services then the LE incorrectly reflects the title fees in section C and the title fees would be required to be held to a 0% tolerance and the 0% tolerance would be exceeded, with no further cure provided.


Seller Comment (2016-03-22): Seller provided a copy of an executed Confirmation of Decision to Shop for Services in which the borrower indicates they choose not to shop and to allow lender to select the appropriate Title Agent and executed on 11/5/2015.

Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-15): Although the transfer taxes in question were paid by seller they are a typical borrower paid fee and would have been a seller paid borrower closing costs and would required to be included in the 0% tolerance category.  The initial CD in the file reflects the transfer taxes as lender paid which resets the baseline for this fee to $0.


Seller Comment (2016-04-15): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the transfer taxes were paid by Seller so no refund is due.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-11): Review of the file reflects the transfer taxes were reflected on the LE dated 11/17; however, the initial CD provided dated 1/8/2016 reflected the transfer taxes paid by lender, which restarts the baseline to $0 paid by borrower and final CD reflects transfer taxes paid by borrower.  0% exceeded by $1,045.

Seller Comment (2016-05-13): Client requested review under 130(b)


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-08): The documentation provided by lender has a sufficient cure amount but was provided to the borrower over 60 days from consummation.


Seller Comment (2016-04-08): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 4/5/2016 with a total tolerance cure of $151, a copy of the letter to the borrower, a copy of a refund check for $1 and evidence of delivery to the borrower.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-17): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 3/13/2016 which reflects a tolerance cure of $150; however, the initial Closing Disclosure dated 1/8/2016 reflects the flood cert fee as $7.58 borrower paid and $1 lender paid and the final Closing Disclosure reflects $8.58 borrower paid.  Using the baseline of $7.58 the 0% tolerance for the flood cert is exceeded by $1.  The $150 tolerance cure is for the $150 tolerance violation of the CDA, so a total cure should have been $151.  Condition remains.

TRID Lender Credit Tolerance
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - 0% tolerance violation:  Lender credit disclosed on the Final Closing Disclosure is less than previously disclosed Lender credit plus disclosed Tolerance Cure Amount, resulting in an increased charge to borrower.
$2835 Lender Credit reflected on LE, $1126 Lender paid fees and $150 Lender credit for tolerance cure reflected on Final CD.  .  Valid Changed Circumstance was not found in file to justify this decreased lender credit.

Low DTI of 16.37%
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-21): Post consummation CD provided cures the exception as lender moved the lender paid hazard insurance amount of $1,709 into the lender credit amount for a total credit of $1,860 which includes the cure of $151.


Seller Comment (2016-04-21): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 4/20/2016 with a lender credit of $-1,860.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-11): Review of the file reflects the lender provided a reimbursement for hazard insurance premium on the Summaries of Transaction section under adjustments; however, this should have been reflected on page 2 as paid by other rather than reflected as borrower paid.  Re-disclosure would be required to cure.


Seller Comment (2016-04-08): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the lender credit amount remained the same and provided a copy of portions of the final CD from closing that reflects total paid by others as $1,126 on pg 2 and an adjustment of reimbursed hazard premium from lender of $1,709 on the summaries of transaction.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-17): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 3/13/2016 which reflects the same lender paid fees as $1,126 and tolerance cure of $150 which is still less than previously disclosed total lender credit of $2,835 on LE's with no further documentation provided for a valid COC.  Condition remains.

711 representative FICO score > 660 guideline minimum

Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-18): If a rate is locked prior to closing, lender must issue a revised LE within 3 days of rate lock. If rate is locked within 4 days of closing, lender has 3 options:
1. Disclose LE on same day as rate lock to give borrower required 4 day waiting period from LE to closing
2. Disclose LE within 3 days of rate lock and delay closing so borrower is given required 4 day waiting period from LE to closing
3. Disclose using initial CD (no rate lock section but initial CD should reflect terms of rate lock (rate, fees, loan terms, etc)


Seller Comment (2016-05-18): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating the rate was locked on 1/21/2016 not 2/9/2016 and provided a copy of the rate lock.  Lender also indicated that consummation date is 2/16/2016 and initial disclosures went out on 1/7 with the first CD being issued on 2/9.


Reviewer Comment (2016-02-25): Only LE in file is dated 1/7/2016, loan was locked 2/9/2016 and 1st CD disclosed same day, which is NOT less than 4 business days from the closing date of 2/16/2015, so NOT allowed per TRID rules.  In order to lock a loan and not re-disclose an LE, lock must be < 4 days prior to closing.

CD reflects only a $33 cure.  Should be 628.93, $595.60 increase in discount points from the most recent valid Loan Estimate/Closing Disclosure + $33.33 increase in credit report fees.
10 months reserves > 6 months guideline minimum

32.09% DTI is below 43%

Residual income of $8,502.42 is in excess of the program requirement of $2,007.95
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-08): The cure documentation provided by lender is sufficient.


Seller Comment (2016-04-08): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure date 3/31/2016 with a tolerance cure amount of $628.93, a copy of the letter to the borrower, a copy of the refund check for the difference of $595.60 and evidence of delivery to the borrower within 60 days of consummation.

Seller Comment (2016-04-08): Lender provided the title agents final escrow settlement statement dated 2/19/2016 and a rebuttal indicating that the initial CD was provided on 2/5 and the final Cd was provided on 2/12, no additional CD's exist.  As Wa is an escrow state and fees were updated after the original closing docs were signed a post funding CD was issued on 3/3/2016 to match the figures provided on the Final Escrow Settlement Statement provided.  The changes include decreased interest at funding, seller credit attributed to this interest amount was reallocated to the commitment fee and a mobile notary fee was added which lender was previously unaware but once added is still within 10% tolerance.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-24): These post-close CDs reflect various added/changed/reduced fees and increased cash needed to close (not explained).  TheTOP calculation on the 3/17 CD is accurate based solely on that CD, however is not accurate based on the final CD.

TRID Closing Disclosure Issue Date Not Provided
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure: Closing Disclosure estimated to be provided on  2/3/2016 did not disclose the actual Date Issued. Compliance testing may be unreliable using an estimated Date Issued based on best information available. (Interim/02/03/2016)
 
The loan presents the following compensating factors: 1) residual income of $18177 is above minimum required amount of $4963, 2) the co- borrower has additional income which is not used in the effective income 3) 58 months of perfect mortgage history with <redacted>. Items of Note: Borrower has stated intention to sell current owner occupied property however qualified with both payments in final ratios.
Reviewer Comment (2016-05-19): Additional CD with the Disclosure issue Date was provided on 2/3/2016 with an additional one provided on 2/12/2016 reflecting the Issue Date.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-08): Please provide the date the CD was provided to the borrower by the title agent to the attestation.


Seller Comment (2016-04-08): Lender provided an attestation that the CD in question was provided to lender by title agent for use as a "fee sheet" and was for the sole purpose of capturing any settlement related fees of which lender was not previously aware.  Lender additionally indicates that the title agent did review this CD with the borrower but the borrower indicated that the CD was not applicable to the transaction on the signature line.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-24): There are two different CDs that have been tested using the 2/3/16 issue date:  one that reflects the 2/13 issue date (lender provided another copy of this one) and the other that reflects no issue date, but reflects a 2/3 print date at the bottom.  This exception refers to the latter CD.


Seller Comment (2016-03-24): 3/18/16 Lender provided another copy of the CD with issue date 2/3/16, and states Seller's system identifies that the initial CD was delivered electronically to the borrower on 2/3/2016.  The below image is from the Seller system which tracks disclosures that are sent and received by the borrowers.  This disclosure was received by the borrower on 2/3/2016 and was electronically signed and returned the same day.  I have attached an image of the tracking screen as well as a screen shot of the esigned CD.  CD was received more than 3 business days prior to closing.  Closing was on 2/19/2016.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-24): We had tested two CDs using a 2/3 Issue Date:  one that reflects the 2/13 issue date (lender provided another copy of this) and the other that reflects no issue date, but reflects a 2/3 print date at the borrom.  This exception refers to the latter CD.


Seller Comment (2016-03-24): 3/17/16 Lender provided another copy of the CD with issue date 2/3/16.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure With Seller - Total Closing Costs Exceeds Limits
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Calculating Cash to Close: Final Closing Disclosure provided on 2/19/2016 disclosed an inaccurate value of the dollar amount by which the Total Closing Costs exceeded the legal limit. (Final/02/19/2016)
10% Violation cost to cure 1415.12. 0% Violation cost to cure 530.00. Total cure required 1945.12. Cure provided at closing 1489.38
The loan presents the following compensating factors: 1) residual income of $18177 is above minimum required amount of $4963, 2) the co- borrower has additional income which is not used in the effective income 3) 58 months of perfect mortgage history with <redacted>. Items of Note: Borrower has stated intention to sell current owner occupied property however qualified with both payments in final ratios.
Reviewer Comment (2016-05-12): While the documentation provided and additional refund amount creates a sufficient cure, it was provided outside the required 60 days of consummation as well as discovery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-08): The documentation provided by lender is still missing the prior re-disclosed post consummation CD dated 3/16/2016 letter to borrower, copy of check for that refund amount and evidence of delivery to borrower within 60 days of consummation.  Condition remains for those prior missing items.


Seller Comment (2016-04-08): Lender provided a post consummation Closing Disclosure dated 4/1/2016 that reflects an total cure of $1,945.12 along with a letter to the borrower, a copy of a check for $.74 and evidence of delivery to borrower within 60 days of consummation.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-24): NOTE:  the 10% violation excludes the $.40 rounding amount on the settlement fee.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-24): Total cure required = $1944.72 (10% = 1414.72, appraisal = 75, commitment = 455).  Cure reflected on final CD was $1489.38.  Post Close 3/16 CD reflects cure of $1944.38 (further evidence of cure to follow).  Missing corrected post-close CD reflecting total cure of $1944.72, letter to borrower, copy of refund check ($455.34), and proof of delivery.


Seller Comment (2016-03-24): RESPA cost to cure for 0% fee tolerance for appraisal fee ($75 cure) and 10% violation for Lender Title Insurance ($1414.38 cure) were calculated correctly.  Final inspection fee was not charged to the customer.  Cost to cure at closing was $1489.38, which was accurate.  0% fee tolerance for Commitment Fee ($455 cure) was not calculated correctly and a RESPA cure was not applied at closing.  Additional documentation will be provided to cure Commitment Fee violation.

TRID Interim Closing Disclosure Timing
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Interim Closing Disclosure was not received by the borrower at least three (3) business days prior to consummation.
 
Borrower has residual income of $3,887.53 which exceeds the required of $2,735

Required reserves 6 months, actual reserves 36 months
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-13): Review of the documentation with outside counsel with a response:  OC opinion is that while the attempted cure may help to mitigate some of the risk from a practical perspective, it would not appear to cure the issue.
The change in APR between interim and final CD and the failure to properly provide an additional 3 day waiting period prior to consummation may appear to be an APR issue, but is really is a timing issue and would not appear to be curable. Refund to reduce the final CD APR post-consummation such that a new 3 day period would not have been needed if that reduced APR had been on the final CD would not negate the requirement for a new 3 day waiting period at the time the APR became inaccurate requiring a re-disclosure.
Accordingly, as noted, while the refund may mitigate risk associated with the violation, it does not effectively cure the timing violation.


Seller Comment (2016-05-13): Lender provided a Letter to the borrower notifying the correction of the APR and evidence of delivery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-12): We submitted an inquiry to outside counsel to determine if a restitution made post-closing that brings the APR within tolerance for accuracy of previously disclosed APR could be considered a de facto cure to a timing violation, however, irrespective of OC response, the letter of explanation provided to the borrower when the refund and corrected CD was provided is not sufficient to cure as it does not specifically address/notify borrower of the error (failure provide requisite 3-day waiting period prior to consummation for a change in APR that requires a new waiting period). The LOE only addresses the fees and 10% tolerance and further states that monthly payment and terms of loan are not affected.


Seller Comment (2016-05-12): Lender requested status update.


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-12): Lender rebuttal indicates APR issue cured with post consummation CD and cure package provided.  Item is in for further review and and update will be forthcoming.


Seller Comment (2016-05-12): Lender provided a rebuttal and copy of post consummation CD / cure package.


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-12): Review of the file reflects the  issue is actually that the APR from the initial CD on 2/17 increased by more than .125% to the final CD and no re-disclosed CD was provided within the 3 days required prior to closing.  It looks like the APR increase was mainly caused by the initial CD reflecting the discount points as seller paid and the final CD reflecting the fee as borrower paid.


Seller Comment (2016-04-26): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 4/20/2016.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-23): While the Initial CD was received 2/17, this is exception refers to the fact that the APR increased on the final closing disclosed and was not adequately disclosed prior to.


Seller Comment (2016-03-23): 3/17/16 Lender provided another copy of one of the  2/17/16 CDs (also in file).

TRID Final Closing Disclosure Homeowner's Insurance Premium Months
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Other Costs: Final Closing Disclosure provided on  2/3/2016 disclosed homeowner's insurance under Prepaids that does not match amount per month calculation. (Final/02/03/2016)
CD reflects  $152.31, should be $924.96 ($77.08 x 12 months)
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-08): Condition cleared due to lender providing the Security Instrument Notary page which makes the closing/consummation date 2/10/2016 and the final CD dated 2/9/2016 and the 2/3/2016 CD an interim so dates updated and correct exceptions set.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-08): Lender's rebuttal indicates that the amount collected was the remaining balance due on the annual policy, which means the number of months collected for prepaid HOI is incorrect as 12 and should reflect the correct number of months remaining.


Seller Comment (2016-04-08): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the amount reflected is the remaining balance of the annual policy that was due.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure With Seller - Total Closing Costs Exceeds Limits
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Calculating Cash to Close: Final Closing Disclosure provided on  2/9/2016 disclosed an inaccurate value of the dollar amount by which the Total Closing Costs exceeded the legal limit. (Final/02/09/2016)
Cure for Transfer Tax Fee of $2362.50 was not provided.
LTV of 75% is below the max allowed of 90%.

Residual income of $4899.63 is above the required amount of $2819.
Reviewer Comment (2016-06-02): system


Reviewer Comment (2016-05-16): Post consummation CD and applicable cure documentation provided still does not reflect the amount that exceeds the legal limit on pg 3 (Total Closing Costs line) but only has the verbiage that it includes lender cure for the increase in costs above the legal limit without the amount.  In addition the cure documentation provided is outside the required 60 days of discovery.


Seller Comment (2016-05-16): Lender provided a post consummation CD dated 5/13/2016, letter to the borrower and evidence of delivery.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-21): Although there is a lender credit for $2,362.50 on the final CD, the CD does not indicate this was a tolerance cure on pg 2 bottom nor did it indicate that this is the amount that exceeds the legal limits on pg 3 calculating cash to close table.


Seller Comment (2016-04-21): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that the lender credit amount on the final CD of $2,362.50 was the cure for the transfer taxes.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-07): Audit is unable to confirm that Maryland transfer taxes are split 50/50, documentation found indicates it is negotiable and that buyer pays Mortgage tax.  While it is confirmed that the initial LE had the transfer taxes listed it was subsequently removed from the final LE, and final LE is being used as a baseline.  Seller paid borrower required fees are still subject to tolerance, 0% tolerance exceeded for transfer taxes with no evidence of cure.


Seller Comment (2016-04-07): Lender provided a rebuttal indicating that in Maryland it is typical for the buyer / seller to split transfer taxes 50/50 and provided a portion of some form of documentation that indicates this.  Lender also provided a portion of the initial LE that reflects transfer taxes of $2,400 disclosed to borrower.  Lender also indicated that the seller paid all the transfer taxes, therefore no cure is required.

TRID Alternate Table Usage
TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Costs at Closing/ Calculating Cash to Close: Alternate tables not used consistently throughout the transaction.
1 disclosure was issued on the "With Seller" form, and 7 disclosures were issued on the "Without Seller" form.
 
Reviewer Comment (2016-05-13): Review of the file reflects that the initial LE provided was on "without seller" form while re-disclosed LE dated 12/30/2015 and all subsequent LE's and CD's are on "without seller" form.  Lender cured with re-disclosed LE's.


Reviewer Comment (2016-04-05): Seller states that they can find no disclosure on "With Seller" form.  Broker issued disclosure on "With Seller" form and lender is required to follow that format to ensure continuity.


Seller Comment (2016-04-05): Seller states that they can find no disclosure on "With Seller" form.

TRID Final Closing Disclosure With Seller - Total Closing Costs Exceeds Limits

Cure of $57.30 was reflected, which is insufficient to cover the required cure of $583 due to 0% tolerance violations.
20 months reserves > 9 months guideline minimum

38% DTI on this Full documentation loan < 43% guideline max

Borrower on this Full documentation loan has a disposable income of $7320.55 which is greater than the required amount of $2181.76.
Reviewer Comment (2016-03-31): Review of the file reflects the SSPL contained a settlement service provider that the borrower could shop for; however service provider differed from the settlement agent on the final CD.  Title fees should be subject to 10% tolerance since borrower could shop.  Final Closing Disclosure reflects a cure of $57.30 which was sufficient to cure the 10% tolerance.  Condition cleared.


Seller Comment (2016-03-31): Lender provided a rebuttal along with a tolerance comparison printout and indicated that the title fees should be subject to 10% tolerance not 0% tolerance and that a sufficient cure was provided of $57.30.

TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure - Calculating Cash to Close: Final Closing Disclosure provided on  3/3/2016 did not disclose the dollar amount by which the Total Closing Costs exceeded the legal limit. (Final/03/03/2016)
In regards to 0% violation.
Borrower on this loan has residual income in excess of $8000; guideline is $3080.58.

DTI of 40.953% is below max of 43%.

Reserves of $51584.12 in excess of guideline of $48000.

VOR and credit report reflect 0x30x40, beyond guideline of 0x30x12.
Reviewer Comment (2016-04-11): Review of file reflects issue is not a tolerance violation but rather a terminology issue with the LE's and initial CD reflecting Electronic Doc Delivery fee and final and post consummation CD's reflecting Recording Service Fee.  Condition cleared.


Seller Comment (2016-04-11): Lender provided a rebuttal that the fee should be included in the 10% tolerance category and 10% tolerance not exceeded.


Reviewer Comment (2016-03-25): While other title fees were reflected on the SSPL, the Title - Recording Fee was not.  Since the borrower was not given the opportunity to shop for this fee, it is subject to 0% tolerance.  Missing cure for $22.50.


Seller Comment (2016-03-25): 3/23/16 Lender states This is an invalid finding.  The Title - Recording Service Fee is a fee that is subject to a cumulative tolerance - it is not part of the fees which are subject to 0% tolerance.  Please see screenshots below from Seller's Loan Operating System (LOS) which illustrates those fees which are subject to a 0% tolerance and those fees which are subject to 10% tolerance.  Therefore no cure is required.

Reviewer Comment (2016-04-19): Lender rebuttal indicates that these are not the same fees and that the recording service fee of $22.50 was added at final CD preparation.  Since this service is not listed on the service provider list and was not in section C of the LE and never disclosed to the borrower allowing them to shop for service the fee would be held to a 0% tolerance.  This exception being cleared and 0% tolerance violations added.


Seller Comment (2016-04-19): Lender provided a rebuttal that during collaboration with the settlement agent for preparation of the final CD on 2/29/2015, the settlement agent provided lender with updated title charges and the electronic delivery fee of $23 was removed and a recording service fee of $22.50 was added and was included in the 10% tolerance with no threshold breach.
