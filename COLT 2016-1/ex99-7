Independent Accountants’ Report
on Applying Agreed-Upon Procedures
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have performed the procedures described
below, which were agreed to by LSRMF Acquisitions I, LLC (the “Company”) and Hudson Americas L.P. (“Hudson Americas”)
and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (“Credit Suisse” and, together with Hudson Americas and the Company, the “Specified
Parties”) related to their evaluation of certain information with respect to a portfolio of mortgage loans in conjunction
with the proposed offering of COLT 2016-1, Mortgage-Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-1 (the “Transaction”).
 
This agreed-upon procedures engagement was
conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The sufficiency
of these procedures is solely the responsibility of the Specified Parties of this report. Consequently, we make no representations
regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described below either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or
for any other purpose.
 
 
Agreed-Upon Procedures 
 
On May 6, 2016, representatives of Hudson Americas,
on behalf of the Company, provided us with (i) a computer-generated mortgage loan data file and related record layout with respect
to 377 mortgage loans (the “Initial Data File”) and (ii) a supplemental data file containing the maturity date for
each of the 377 mortgage loans included on the Initial Data File (the “Supplemental Data File”). At the Company’s
instruction, we appended the Initial Data File with the information set forth on the Supplemental Data File. The Initial Data File,
as adjusted, is hereinafter referred to as the “Statistical Data File.”
 
At the Company’s instruction,
we randomly selected 190 mortgage loans (the “Sample Loans”) from the Statistical Data File and performed certain comparisons
and recomputations for each of the Sample Loans relating to the mortgage loans characteristics (the “Characteristics”)
set forth on the Statistical Data File and indicated below.

* For adjustable rate loans only
We compared Characteristics 2. through 15.
to the corresponding information set forth on or derived from the respective Fixed Rate Note, Adjustable Rate Note or Modification
Agreement (collectively, the “Note”); Characteristic 16. to the Note or Prepayment Penalty Rider (collectively, the
“Prepayment Penalty Rider”); Characteristic 17. to the Note or Interest Only Addendum (collectively, the “Interest
Only Addendum”); Characteristic 18. to the Residential Loan Application (the “Application”); Characteristics
19. and 20. to the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (the “Appraisal Report”); Characteristics 21. and 22. (for
those Sample Loans for which the loan purpose field appearing on the Statistical Data File indicated a “first time home purchase”
or “other-than-first-time home purchase”) to the “Settlement Statement,” “Closing Disclosure”
and/or Application (as applicable) and Characteristic 23. to the Settlement Statement or “Underwriting Summary” (collectively,
the “Junior Lien Summary”).
 
Further, with respect to Characteristic 22.,
for those Sample Loans for which the loan purpose is indicated on the Statistical Data File as a (i) “rate/term refinance
- borrower initiated” or (ii) cash out: debt consolidation, cash out: home improvement/renovation or cash out: other/multi-purpose/unknown
purpose (collectively, “cash out refinance”), we (i) observed that there was no sales price indicated on the Settlement
Statement and (ii) recalculated the “Amount to the Borrower” as the difference between (a) the original principal balance
(as set forth on the Note) and (b) the sum of (1) the unpaid principal balance of the refinanced first mortgage loan, (2) the unpaid
principal balance of any “secondary financing” relating to the subject property and (3) settlement charges relating
to the subject mortgage loan (each as set forth on the Settlement Statement). At the Company’s instruction, we assumed that
the loan purpose is (a) a cash out refinance if the Amount to the Borrower is greater than the greater of (i) $2,000 or (ii) 2%
of the original principal balance (as set forth on the Note) and (b) a “rate/term refinance - borrower initiated” to
the extent that it was not.
 
With respect to Characteristic 24.,
we recomputed the original loan-to-value ratio by dividing (a) the original principal balance (as set forth on the Note) by either
(b) in the case of a first time home purchase or other-than-first-time home purchase (as derived from the Settlement Statement,
Closing Disclosure and/or Application (as applicable)), the lesser of (i) the appraised value (as determined below) and (ii) sales
price (as set forth on the Settlement Statement) or (c) in the case of a rate/term refinance - borrower initiated or cash out refinance
(as determined above), the appraised value (as determined below), except for those Sample Loans indicated in Appendix A for which
we were instructed by representatives of Hudson Americas, on behalf of the Company, to use the “previous purchase price”
(as set forth on the “Previous Settlement Statement”).
 

 
 

With respect to Characteristic 25.,
we recomputed the combined loan-to-value ratio by dividing (a) the sum of (i) the original principal balance (as set forth on the
Note) and (ii) the junior lien balance, if any (as set forth on the Junior Lien Summary) by either (b) in the case of a first time
home purchase or other-than-first-time home purchase (as derived from the Settlement Statement, Closing Disclosure and/or Application
(as applicable)), the lesser of (x) the appraised value (as determined below) and (y) the sales price (as set forth on the Settlement
Statement) or (c) in the case of a rate/term refinance - borrower initiated or cash out refinance (as determined above), the appraised
value (as determined below), except for those Sample Loans indicated in Appendix A for which we were instructed by representatives
of Hudson Americas, on behalf of the Company, to use the previous purchase price (as set forth on the Previous Settlement Statement).
 
At your instruction, for purposes of the procedures described
above:
 

·with respect to our comparison of Characteristics 19. and 20. and for the
recalculations of Characteristics 24. and 25., for those Sample Loans for which the Company provided us with more than one Appraisal
Report or an Appraisal Report and an “Appraisal Field Review Report,” each noting an appraisal date less than 30 days
from the origination date (as set forth on the Note), we were instructed to use the report with the lowest appraised value; and
 

·with respect to our comparison of Characteristics 24. and 25., differences of 0.0001% or less are
noted to be “in agreement.”
 
The mortgage loan
documents described above and any other related documents used in support of the Characteristics were provided to us by representatives
of the Company and are collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Loan Documents.” We were not requested to perform,
and we did not perform, any procedures with respect to the preparation or verification of any of the information set forth on the
Loan Documents and we make no representations concerning the accuracy or completeness of any of the information contained therein.
In certain instances, our procedures were performed using data imaged facsimiles or photocopies of the Loan Documents. In addition,
we make no representations as to whether the Loan Documents are comprehensive or valid instruments or reflect the current prevailing
terms with respect to the corresponding Sample Loans.
 
 
Agreed-Upon Procedures’ Findings
 
The results of the foregoing procedures indicated
that the Characteristics set forth on the Statistical Data File were found to be in agreement with the above mentioned Loan Documents,
except as described in Appendix B. Supplemental information is contained on Appendix C.
 
******
 
We make no representations as to the (i) actual
characteristics or existence of the underlying documents or data comprising the mortgage loans or underlying documentation underlying
the Statistical Data File or the conformity of their characteristics with those assumed for purposes of the procedures described
herein, (ii) existence or ownership of the mortgage loans or (iii) reasonableness of any of the aforementioned assumptions, information
or methodologies.
 
It should be understood that we make no representations
as to questions of legal interpretation or as to the sufficiency for your purposes of the procedures enumerated in the preceding
paragraphs. Also, such procedures would not necessarily reveal any material misstatement of the

 
 

information referred to above. The information
provided to us, including the information set forth in the Statistical Data File, is the responsibility of the Company.
 
We were not engaged to conduct, and did not
conduct, an (i) audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards or (ii) examination or a review conducted
in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the objective of
which would be the expression of an opinion or limited assurance on the accompanying information. Accordingly, we do not express
such an opinion, limited assurance, or any other form of assurance, including reasonable assurance. Had we performed additional
procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you. We have no responsibility to update
this report for events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report.
 
None of the engagement, procedures
or report was intended to address, nor did they address, the (i) conformity of the origination of the assets to stated underwriting
or credit extension guidelines, standards, criteria or other requirements, (ii) value of collateral securing such assets or (iii)
compliance of the originator of the assets with federal, state, and local laws and regulations.
 
None of the engagement, procedures
or report were intended to satisfy, nor did they satisfy, any criteria for due diligence published by a nationally recognized statistical
rating organization.
 
This report is intended solely for the information and
use of the Specified Parties identified above and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these Specified
Parties.
 
Yours truly,
