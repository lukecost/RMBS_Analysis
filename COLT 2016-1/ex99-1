DUE DILIGENCE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY






EXHIBIT 99.1
Due Diligence Executive Summary
 
(1) Type of assets that were reviewed.
AMC Diligence, LLC (“AMC”) performed certain
due diligence services (the “Review”) described below on residential mortgage loans originated by Caliber Home Loans,
Inc. (“CHL”) and acquired by LSRMF Acquisitions I, LLC (the “Client”). The projects were conducted from
August 2015 through May 2016 via files imaged and provided by CHL for review.
 
(2) Sample size of the assets reviewed.
The Review was conducted on 100% of the securitization
mortgage loan population and consisted of 368 mortgage loans with an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $163.8
million. The mortgage loans were originated from July 2015 to March 2016 by CHL or its correspondents.
 
(3) Determination of the sample size and computation.
The Review was conducted consistent with the criteria
for the NRSRO(s) as defined below:

Additionally, AMC verified (i) listed borrowers signed
documents requiring signature, (ii) borrowers signing documents were eighteen (18) years or older at the time of the mortgage loan
origination, (iii) that all riders required by the terms of the mortgage and mortgage note were attached to the respective document,
(iv) that social security numbers across documents were consistent, and (v) debt-to-income ratio (“DTI(s)”) and/or
loan-to-value ratios (“LTV(s)”)  used in the assessment of conformity guidelines.
 
(5) Origination of the assets and conformity to
stated underwriting or credit extension guidelines, standards, criteria or other requirements: review and methodology.
AMC reviewed asset origination to determine conformity
to the stated underwriting or credit extension guidelines, standards, criteria or other requirements, including, as applicable,
the Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage requirements described below, that were provided to AMC and/or as directed by Client.
When applicable, a review of the mortgage loan file to the Automated Underwriting System output within the file was also performed.
 
Credit Application 
For the Credit Application, AMC verified that the
application: (i) was signed by all listed borrowers, (ii) was substantially filled out, (iii) contained all known borrower-owned
properties on the Real Estate Owned section 2, and (iv) included the borrower’s employment history.
 
Credit Report 
AMC’s review included confirming that a credit
report, that met guideline requirements, was present for each borrower and that such borrower’s credit profile adhered to
guidelines. In order to make this determination, AMC: (i) captured the monthly consumer debt payments for use in relevant calculations,
(ii) noted and researched the Real Estate Owned and fraud alerts, (iii) gathered liabilities listed on the credit report to be
included in the debt to income ratio as appropriate, and (iv) gathered data required for the ASF tape submission including (a)
the most recent FICO (scores from Equifax, Experian, and Transunion if available), (b) the most recent FICO date, (c) the longest
trade line, (d) the maximum trade line, (e) the number of trade lines, and (f) the credit usage ratio.

Employment and Income 
AMC determined whether applicable supporting employment
and income documentation required by the guidelines, and as applicable, Appendix Q or ATR, was present in the mortgage loan file
and where possible, wasn’t fraudulent. This documentation was used to verify whether the income used to qualify the mortgage
loan was calculated in accordance with guidelines and may have included items such as: (i) verbal or written verification of employment,
(ii) pay stubs, (iii) W-2 forms, (iv) tax returns, (v) financial statements and (vi) IRS tax transcripts.
 
Asset Review 
AMC assessed whether the asset documentation
required by the guidelines, and as applicable, Appendix Q or ATR, was present in the mortgage loan file. Utilizing this
documentation, AMC completed a review of the reserve calculation and any large deposits. Documentation verifying assets for
down payment, closing costs, prepaid items and reserves may have included: (i) verification-of-deposit (“VOD(s)”), (ii)
depository account statements, (iii) stock or security account statements, (iv) gift funds, (v) escrow or earnest money
deposits, and (vi) settlement statements or other evidence of conveyance and transfer of funds (if a sale of assets was
involved).
 
Hazard/Flood Insurance/Taxes 
A review of the insurance present on the mortgage
loan was also performed by AMC. During the course of this review, AMC (i) verified that the hazard insurance met the minimum required
amount of coverage in the guidelines, (ii) confirmed that the mortgage clause listed the lender’s name and “its successors
and assigns,” (iii) confirmed that the premium amount on both the hazard and flood insurance matched what was used in the
DTI calculations, (iv) reviewed the tax certificate to verify and compare monthly escrows used to calculate DTI matched and that
taxes were current, (v) confirmed that the flood certification was for the correct borrower, property, lender and mortgage loan
number and was a “Life of Loan” certification, and (vi) completed other property specific items including (a) for condominium
properties, confirming that the blanket policy met the minimum amount of coverage and (b) for properties in a flood zone per the
flood certification, confirming that flood insurance met guideline requirements in the file and met the minimum required amount
of coverage.
 
DU/LP Review 
When provided and appropriate, AMC verified that DU
findings included an approved/ineligible decision as required per guidelines. However, all mortgage loans are manually underwritten
with documentation requirements determined by Client guidelines and not AUS findings.
 
Occupancy Review 
AMC confirmed the property occupancy is consistent
with the mortgage loan approval and borrowers’ application disclosure based solely on information contained in the mortgage
loan file and any fraud report obtained in connection with the mortgage loan.
 
Guideline Review
During the course of the review, AMC confirmed the
mortgage loan was originated in accordance with required guidelines by reviewing conformity of mortgage loan, transaction type,
and borrower characteristics to stated guidelines. Mortgage characteristics examined included (i) DTI of the borrower, (ii) the
LTV/TLTV/HTLTV, (iii) the credit score for each borrower, (iv) asset reserves of the borrower, (v) property type, (vi) property
usage, and (vii) other property specific items including (a) for condominium or cooperative properties, assessing whether the condominium
or cooperative project adheres to required guidelines.
 
Fraud Review
AMC reviewed fraud report results in each file, to
the extent present, in conjunction with source documents found in the file to assess the likelihood of any misrepresentations associated
with the origination of the mortgage loan. If the mortgage loan did not contain a fraud report and the counterparty did not produce
one, AMC conditioned the mortgage loan for the missing fraud report product.
 
If a report was present, AMC reviewed the report for
(i) any name variations for the borrowers, (ii) any social security number variations for the borrowers, (iii) any potential occupancy
issues based on the borrower’s address history, (iv) any noted employment issues, and (v) any additional consumers associated
with the borrower’s profile. If any findings

 2 | Page
 
 
were noted, AMC confirmed that such findings and/or
variations were addressed by the originator in the origination of the asset or that such red flag issues were fully addressed via
mortgage loan documentation provided.
 
Title Review
AMC’s review included a review of the chain
of title and the duration of ownership by the seller or borrower (whichever is applicable) satisfied the underwriting guidelines.
Included in this review was a verification of whether the appropriate vestee was on the title documentation (if a purchase, the
seller; if a refinance, the borrower) and that the title commitment addressed issues such as assessments; covenants, conditions
and restrictions; access problems; vicinity of property to military airports; prior leases; court orders/divorce decrees; public
probate issues; foreclosures; bankruptcies; judgment liens; state and federal tax liens; environmental liens, and oil/gas leases.
 
Additional Review of Mortgage Loan File 
AMC also reviewed the closing documents to ensure
that the mortgage loan file information is complete, accurate, and contains consistent documentation. Included in the portion of
the review are items such as reviewing for (i) evidence of primary mortgage insurance, (ii) if the property is located in an area
that was listed as a FEMA disaster zone post origination, (iii) the presence of loan modification documents, and (iv) general conformity
to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac approved formats at the time of origination.
 
If standard GSE forms were not used for the mortgage
loan, AMC sought to confirm the existence of: (i) a “due on sale” clause, (ii) mortgagors’ requirement to maintain
adequate insurance at the mortgagor’s own expense, and (iii) the holder’s right to foreclose and to confirm that any
homestead exemption has been waived as required by applicable law within the forms utilized.
 
(6) Value of collateral securing the assets: review
and methodology.
AMC’s review included a review of the valuation
materials utilized during the origination of the loan and in confirming the value of the underlying property. AMC’s review
included verifying the appraisal report was (i) on the appropriate GSE form, (ii) materially complete, (iii) in conformity with
the guideline requirements for the property type in question, (iv) completed by an appraiser that was actively licensed to perform
the valuation, (v) completed such that the named client on the appraisal report is the lender or a related entity that is permitted
to engage the lender per Title XI of FIRREA, (vi) made and signed prior to the final approval of the mortgage loan application,
(vii) completed and dated within the guidelines restrictions, (vii) made on an “as is” basis or provides satisfactory
evidence of completion of all material conditions including all inspections, licenses, and certificates (including certificates
of occupancy) to be made or issued with respect to all occupied portions of the mortgaged property and with respect to the use
and occupancy of the same, have been made or obtained from the appropriate authorities.
 
With regard to the use of comparable properties, AMC’s
review (i) captured the relative comparable data (gross and net adjustments, sale dates and distance from subject property) and
ensured that such comparable properties are within standard appraisal guidelines; (ii) confirmed the property value and square
footage of the subject property was bracketed by comparable properties, (iii) verified that comparable properties used are similar
in size, style, and location to the subject, and (iv) checked for the reasonableness of adjustments when reconciling value between
the subject property and comparable properties.
 
Other aspects of AMC’s review included (i) verifying
that the address matched the mortgage note, (ii) verifying that the appraisal  and the policies and procedures with regard
to appraisal, including the appropriate level of review, when originating the mortgage loan, were followed, (iii) noting whether
the property zip code was declared a FEMA disaster area after the valuation date and notifying client of same (iv) confirming the
appraisal report does not include any apparent environmental problems, (v) confirming the appraisal notes the current use of the
property is legal or legal non-conforming (grandfathered), (vi) reviewing pictures to ensure (a) that the property is in average
or better condition and any repairs are noted where required and (b) that the subject property is the one for which the valuation
was ordered and that there are no negative external factors; and (vii) confirming that the value product that was used as part
of the origination decision was directly accessible to AMC or if it was not directly accessible that another valuation product
that was directly accessible to AMC was ordered in accordance with the Client’s specific valuation waterfall process.
 
If more than one valuation was provided, AMC confirmed
consistency among the valuation products and if there were discrepancies that could not be resolved, AMC created an exception and
worked with the client on the next steps which included ordering of additional valuation products such as collateral desktop analyses,
broker’s price opinions and full

 3 | Page
 
 
appraisals. If the property valuation products included
in AMC’s review resulted in a variance of more than 10% then the client was notified of such variance and a second independent
valuation product was ordered.
 
(7) Compliance of the originator of the assets
with federal, state and local laws and regulations: review and methodology.
Please be advised that AMC did not make a determination
as to whether the mortgage loans complied with federal, state or local laws, constitutional provisions, regulations or ordinances
that are not expressly enumerated below. There can be no assurance that the Review uncovered all relevant factors relating to the
origination of the mortgage loans, their compliance with applicable law and regulations and the original appraisals relating to
the mortgaged properties or uncovered all relevant factors that could affect the future performance of the mortgage loans. Furthermore,
the findings reached by AMC are dependent upon its receiving complete and accurate data regarding the mortgage loans from mortgage
loan originators and other third parties upon which AMC is relying in reaching such findings.
 
With regard to TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (“TRID”)
testing, AMC implemented the TRID scope of review referenced within the Regulatory Compliance section (III) based on outside counsel’s
interpretations of the published regulations as of the date of review of each mortgage loan. AMC worked with outside counsel and
continues to obtain updated interpretations relative to the informal guidance provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
(“CFPB”) which has caused alterations in the review scope and severity of TRID related exceptions, including applicable
cures. (This will continue as necessary as additional guidance becomes available, as well as any future rulemaking.) While AMC
continues to make a good faith effort to identify material TRID exceptions and apply the appropriate grading, the implementation
of new regulations (including TRID) that impact residential mortgages carries certain interpretive risk and continues to evolve,
impacting the review scope and exception severity. AMC has worked closely with Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”), DBRS,
Inc. (“DBRS”) and Client to disclose, as mutually agreed upon by the parties, the relevant exceptions per AMC’s
suggested review implementation as reviewed by outside counsel; however, no assurances can be provided and/or are given that AMC
has included within its Review all areas that may represent risk to the securitization trust, or that areas of risk identified
by AMC will result in the potential level of risk indicated by an Event Level or NRSRO grade.
 
Please be further advised that AMC does not employ
personnel who are licensed to practice law in the various jurisdictions, and the findings set forth in the reports prepared by
AMC do not constitute legal advice or opinions. They are recommendations or conclusions based on information provided to AMC. Information
contained in any AMC report related to the applicable statute of limitations for certain claims may not be accurate or reflect
the most recent controlling case law. Further, a particular court in a particular jurisdiction may extend, not enforce or otherwise
allow claims beyond the statute of limitations identified in the report based on certain factors, including the facts and circumstances
of an individual mortgage loan. All final decisions as to whether to purchase or enter into a transaction related to any individual
mortgage loan or the mortgage loans in the aggregate, any investment strategy and any legal conclusions, including the potential
liability related to the purchase or other transaction involving any such mortgage loan or mortgage loans, shall be made solely
by the Client, or other agreed upon party, that has engaged AMC to prepare its reports pursuant to its instructions and guidelines.
The Client, or other agreed upon party, acknowledges and agrees that the scoring models applied by AMC are designed to identify
potential risk and the Client, or other agreed upon party, assumes sole responsibility for determining the suitability of the information
for its particular use. AMC does not make any representation or warranty as to the value of any mortgage loan or mortgage loans
collateral that has been reviewed by AMC.

remediation measures for non-numerical exceptions, that a corrected CD was delivered or placed in the mail no later than 60 days
after consummation. (In an attempt to establish a best practices approach to pre-securitization due diligence, as it applies to
TILA RESPA Integrated Disclosure testing, the Structured Finance Industry Group (“SFIG”) has a working group that consists
of industry participants including third party review providers and law firms who are discussing a standardized approach to remediation
considerations. This approach is intended to be based on a reasoned legal analysis that expressly assumes that courts will interpret
TRID in accordance with the principals of liability set forth in the letter to the MBA from Richard Cordray, the Director of the
CFPB. No assurances can be provided that the courts in question will interpret TRID in accordance with the SFIG industry group
proposal.)

(IV) Sections 1411 and 1412 of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) amending TILA, as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 1026.43,
as set forth below: 

a)The general Ability to Repay (ATR) underwriting
standards (12 C.F.R. 1026.43(c));

b)Refinancing of non-standard mortgages (12 C.F.R.
1026.43(d)); 

c)Qualified Mortgages (QM) (12 C.F.R. 1026.43(e)
(including qualified mortgages as separately defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (24 C.F.R. 201 and 203
et seq.), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (38 C.F.R. Part 36 et seq.); and 

d)Balloon-payment qualified mortgages made by certain
creditors (12 C.F.R. 1026.43(f)). 
 
AMC reviews applicable mortgage loans for compliance
with the ATR and QM rule requirements based upon each mortgage loan’s originator designation (Safe Harbor QM, Higher-priced
QM, Temporary SHQM, Temporary HPQM, Non-QM, Exempt from ATR). AMC determines the mortgage loan’s status under the ATR or
QM rule requirements and assigns a due diligence mortgage loan designation. Generally, AMC notes as a material exception if the
due diligence findings do not confirm the originator’s mortgage loan designation. Additionally, AMC notes if an originator
mortgage loan designation was not provided.
 
Qualified Mortgage
With respect to QM (Safe Harbor and Higher-priced)
designated mortgage loans, AMC reviews the mortgage loan to determine whether, based on available information in the mortgage loan
file: (i) the mortgage loan contains risky mortgage loan features and terms (e.g. an interest only feature or negative amortization),
(ii) the “points and fees” exceed the applicable QM threshold, (iii) the monthly payment was calculated appropriately,
(iv) the creditor considered and verified income or assets at or before consummation, (v) the creditor appropriately considered
debt obligations, alimony

 7 | Page
 
 
and child support, and (vi) at the time of consummation,
if the debt-to-income ratio exceeds 43% (calculated in accordance with Appendix Q to Regulation Z). This portion of the Review
includes a recalculation of all income and liabilities with attention to the appropriate documentation of each source.
 
If a mortgage loan was designated as QM and identified
as eligible for guarantee, purchase, or insurance by an applicable agency as permitted under the QM final rule, AMC reviews the
mortgage loan to determine whether, based on available information in the file, if the mortgage loan satisfied (i), (ii) and (iii)
in the preceding paragraph. In addition, AMC reviews the Automated Underwriting System output within the file to confirm agency
eligibility.
 
For each QM designated mortgage loan that satisfied
the applicable requirements enumerated above, AMC then determines whether the mortgage loan is a Safe Harbor QM or Higher Priced
QM by comparing the mortgage loan’s actual annual percentage rate, as recalculated, to the applicable average prime offer
rate plus a certain applicable percentage. The Review also includes determining, as applicable, whether a mortgage loan is a qualified
mortgage as defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (24 C.F.R. 201 and 203 et seq.), and the Department of Veterans
Affairs (38 C.F.R. Part 36 et seq.).
 
For each QM designated mortgage loan that does not
satisfy the applicable requirements enumerated above, AMC then determines whether the mortgage loan complies with the ATR rule
consideration and verification requirements and provides a due diligence designation of Non-QM compliant or non-compliant.
 
General Ability to Repay
AMC reviews the mortgage loan to determine whether,
based on available information in the mortgage loan file, the creditor considered, as applicable, the following eight underwriting
factors, and verified such information using reasonably reliable third-party records, at or before consummation: (i) the consumer's
current or reasonably expected income or assets, (ii) if the creditor relied on income from the consumer's employment in determining
repayment ability (the consumer's current employment status); (iii) the consumer's monthly payment; (iv) the consumer's monthly
payment on any simultaneous loan that the creditor knows or has reason to know will be made; (v) the consumer's monthly payment
for mortgage-related obligations; (vi) the consumer's current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) the consumer's
monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) the consumer's credit history. This portion of the Review also focuses

determination of the ability to repay.
 
AMC reviews mortgage loans to determine their conformity
with the ATR/QM factors above, and is not rendering an independent assessment or opinion, warranting or representing that a mortgage
loan will be deemed to conform to Safe Harbor, Rebuttable Presumption, ATR or other status based on any additional or revised factors
that may be considered by legislative, regulatory, administrative or judicial authorities (“Authorities”). AMC does
not represent or warrant that the factors for which it is reviewing the mortgage loans constitute all of the factors and/or criteria
that Authorities may consider in determining the status of a mortgage loan. AMC’s review is based on information contained
in the mortgage loan file at the time it is provided to AMC to review, and only reflects information as of that point in time.

may have been amended from time to time;
 
(IX) Federal and state specific late charge and
prepayment penalty provisions.
 
(X) Recording Review
AMC noted the presence of recorded documents, when
available. However, the majority of mortgage loans in the review population were new production and have only been closed for days
or weeks at the time AMC reviewed the mortgage loans and thus have not yet been recorded. AMC verified that documents in the file
(most typically closing instructions) included lender instructions for recording, and as applicable, the date the documents were
sent for recording, and/or the date that the documents will be recorded.
 
As part of the portion of the Review described in
this section, AMC will analyze and capture data from the source documents identified in the Document Review below, as applicable.
 
(XI) FIRREA Review
AMC confirmed that the appraiser and the appraisal
made by such appraiser both satisfied the requirements of Title XI of FIRREA. Specifically, AMC reviewed the appraisal for conformity
to industry standards, including ensuring the appraisal was complete, that the comparable properties and adjustments were reasonable
and that pictures were provided and were accurate. 
 
In addition, AMC accessed the ASC database to verify
that the appraiser, and if applicable the appraiser’s supervisor, were licensed and in good standing at the time the appraisal
was completed. 
 
(XI) Document Review
AMC reviewed each mortgage loan file and verified
if the following documents, if applicable, were included in the file and if the data on these documents was consistent (where applicable):

Initial application (1003);
Underwriting summary / loan approval (1008);

Item 5. Summary of findings and conclusions of
review
The NRSRO criteria referenced for this report and
utilized for grading descriptions is based upon the requirements of Fitch and DBRS.
 
TAPE INTEGRITY REVIEW RESULTS SUMMARY
Of the 368 mortgage loans reviewed, 301 unique mortgage
loans had 476 different tape discrepancies across fourteen (14) data fields (some mortgage loans had more than one data delta).
The largest variances were found on Note Dates and Total Debt Ratios.
 
Note Date variances are primarily due to differences
between tape data showing disbursement dates versus actual Note Dates. Total Debt Ratio variances are the difference on the percentage
of income dedicated toward making debt payments. These variances occur frequently due to differences in calculating complex incomes.
Total Debt Ratio variances that were less than or equal to 300 basis points of absolute value are not included in the population
below.

All the mortgage loans in the securitization have
a Credit grade of BW or higher and 50.54% of the mortgage loans by number have a Credit grade of “A.”

PROPERTY/VALUATION RESULTS SUMMARY (FITCH GRADES)
All the mortgage loans in the securitization have
a Property/Valuation grade of BW or higher and 99.46% of the mortgage loans by number have a Property/Valuation grade of “A.”
There were four (4) mortgage loans that had variances between origination values and Desk Reviews of +/- 10%; however, when a Field
Review was ordered all variances were reduced based upon this second valuation product to lower than +/- 10% resulting in the original
“C” grades being removed.

COMPLIANCE RESULTS SUMMARY (FITCH GRADES)
Approximately 86.41% of all mortgage loans by number
received an “A” or “B” compliance grade. Fifty (50) mortgage loans received a compliance grade of “D”.
All of the exceptions present on the “D” graded mortgage loans are TRID related. Of these exceptions, a portion of
the exceptions are deemed by AMC to be curable if certain actions are taken within a specified time period after close. In many
of these cases, the Client or the originator did not take the required cure action within the prescribed period of time. Due to
the changing nature of TRID regulations and the interpretations of such regulations, the Client or the originator may not have
known that a cure was possible at the time the original exception was issued by AMC. Since becoming aware of the potential for
a cure to exist, the Client or originator may have sought to exercise a cure; however, those actions may have been taken outside
of the cure window.
 
As discussed above, TRID reviews themselves generally
and the grading implications of such reviews specifically have been an evolving topic within the industry. As a result, TRID violations
that exist on mortgage loans that were reviewed before TRID clarifications were made may have resulted in a lower loan grade than
if all parties knew of the potential violation cure at the time of origination and were able to exercise such cure within the applicable
period.
